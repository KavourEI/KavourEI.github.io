Greetings, my name is Themis, and I am a Data Scientist. I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics from Aristotle University in Greece, as well as a Master's Degree in Econometrics and Operations Research from Maastricht University in the Netherlands. I am also currently pursuing a second Master's Degree in Applied Statistics at the Economic University of Athens in Greece.

From the moment I first encountered datasets, I was captivated by the wealth of information they contained and the powerful insights that could be extracted from them. For me, the true challenge of working with data lies in discovering patterns and insights that others might not see.

Through this action, I am aimming to make data science and technological advancements around this area understandable without the need for high level mathematics or statistics, so that eveyone can enjoy the beauty of data science and assess the true value of data.
