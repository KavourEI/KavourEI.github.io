<p> Stability AI has launched three new ControlNets—Blur, Canny, and Depth—for <a href='https://stability.ai/news/introducing-stable-diffusion-3-5'>Stable 
Diffusion 3.5 Large</a>, enhancing image generation capabilities with precision and versatility for various applications.</p>

<p>The evolution of generative AI models continues to reshape creative processes across various industries. Stability AI's latest release, the <strong>
ControlNets for Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large</strong>, introduces powerful new tools designed to enhance the control and quality of image generation. By 
integrating three distinct ControlNets—Blur, Canny, and Depth—this update empowers creators and developers to produce high-fidelity images tailored to their 
specific needs. This article explores the features of these new models and their potential applications in creative workflows.</p>

<p>ControlNets are advanced models that provide users with enhanced control over the image generation process in Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large. Each ControlNet 
is designed to handle different types of inputs, allowing for a wide range of applications from architectural design to character creation. The introduction 
of these models marks a significant step towards more precise and versatile image generation capabilities.</p>

<h3>Key Features of the New ControlNets</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Blur:</strong> This model enables extremely high-fidelity upscaling, supporting resolutions of up to 8K and 16K. It is particularly useful for 
    tiling low-resolution images into large, detailed visuals, making it ideal for projects requiring high-quality outputs.</li>
    <li><strong>Canny:</strong> Leveraging Canny edge maps, this ControlNet helps structure generated images effectively. It is especially beneficial for 
    illustrations but can be adapted across various styles, providing a robust tool for artists and designers.</li>
    <li><strong>Depth:</strong> Utilizing depth maps generated by DepthFM, this model guides image generation with precision. It is particularly advantageous 
    for architectural renderings and texturing 3D assets, allowing users to maintain exact control over the composition of their images.</li>
</ul>

<p>A recent ELO comparison study involving approximately 150 participants revealed that the Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large ControlNets ranked first in user 
preference among similar models. This feedback underscores the effectiveness and appeal of these new tools in enhancing user experience in image generation 
tasks.</p>

<p>The newly released ControlNets are available under the <a href='https://stability.ai/community-license-agreement'>Stability AI Community License</a>, 
which offers several key benefits:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Free for Non-Commercial Use:</strong> Individuals and organizations can utilize the models at no cost for non-commercial purposes, including 
    scientific research.</li>
    <li><strong>Free for Commercial Use (up to $1M in annual revenue):</strong> Startups, small to medium-sized businesses, and creators can use these models 
    commercially without charge as long as their total annual revenue does not exceed $1 million.</li>
    <li><strong>Ownership of Outputs:</strong> Users retain ownership of any media generated without restrictive licensing implications.</li>
</ul>

<p>For organizations with annual revenues exceeding $1 million, Stability AI encourages contacting them directly to inquire about an Enterprise License tailored 
to their needs.</p>

<p>Stability AI emphasizes its commitment to safe and responsible AI practices by implementing measures designed to prevent misuse of its technologies. The 
company continues to take proactive steps throughout the development process to ensure that Stable Diffusion 3.5 is used ethically and responsibly. For more
