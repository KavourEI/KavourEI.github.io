<p>IBM and NASA have introduced a groundbreaking AI foundation model designed to address weather and climate challenges. The open-source model promises a more flexible and scalable approach, providing advanced solutions for short-term weather forecasting and long-term climate projections, available for download on Hugging Face.</p>

<h3>IBM and NASA Launch a New AI Model for Weather and Climate</h3>

<p>In a significant step for meteorology and climate science, IBM and NASA have collaborated to develop a new <a href='https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence'>AI</a> foundation model tailored for a wide range of weather and climate use cases. With contributions from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, this model, dubbed <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13598'>Prithvi WxC</a>, stands out for its versatility and scalability, offering an advanced tool for tackling weather forecasts and climate predictions.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional models, Prithvi WxC can be fine-tuned to suit different scales—global, regional, or local—making it adaptable for various scientific and industry applications. Whether it’s creating localized weather forecasts or refining long-term climate simulations, this AI model represents a leap forward in environmental analysis.</p>

<h3>Groundbreaking Applications: From Severe Weather to Climate Projections</h3>

<p>The weather and climate foundation model offers more than just incremental improvements—it opens new possibilities for tackling complex environmental problems. The model's flexible architecture enables it to be used for multiple applications, including creating targeted forecasts from local data and improving the resolution of global climate simulations. In one notable experiment, the model reconstructed global surface temperatures using only 5% of the original data, highlighting its potential for data assimilation and forecasting in data-sparse environments.</p>

<p>Two specialized fine-tuned versions of the model are available for specific use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li> Climate and Weather Data Downscaling: This version enhances spatial resolution by up to 12x, making it ideal for generating high-resolution climate projections from low-resolution inputs such as temperature, precipitation, and wind data. This version is now available on the IBM Granite Hugging Face page.</li>
<li> Gravity Wave Parameterization: Gravity waves, which influence atmospheric processes like cloud formation and turbulence, have long posed challenges for accurate modeling. The AI model’s ability to better estimate these waves could significantly improve numerical weather and climate models. This fine-tuned version is part of the NASA-IBM Prithvi models on Hugging Face.</li>
<li> Collaborative Innovation and the Path Forward: The model builds on years of collaboration between IBM, NASA, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, with each partner contributing their expertise to enhance AI's role in climate science. Pre-trained on 40 years of Earth observation data from NASA’s MERRA-2 dataset, the model's ability to operate on various scales makes it unique in the field.</li>

<p>According to IBM’s Juan Bernabe-Moreno, the model’s flexibility sets it apart from other large AI models, which often focus on specific datasets or singular applications like forecasting. The new weather and climate foundation model, however, is designed to accommodate multiple inputs and outputs, allowing it to run on both global and local contexts. This opens new doors for studying phenomena like hurricanes, atmospheric rivers, and long-term climate risks.</p>

<h3>Open Access and Future Impact</h3>

<p>Making the model open-source on Hugging Face is a pivotal step (you can access it through the <a href=https://huggingface.co/Prithvi-WxC'>NASA-IBM Hugging Face</a> page and the downscaling mode can be accessed thgouth the <a href='https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite'>IBM Granite Hugging Face</a> page ), democratizing access to cutting-edge climate AI tools. Two versions—the downscaling and gravity wave parameterization models—are now accessible to researchers, developers, and businesses alike. This move follows IBM and NASA’s prior success with the Prithvi geospatial foundation model, which has been used to study disaster patterns, biodiversity, and land-use changes.</p>

<p>Already, IBM is collaborating with Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) to test the model’s capacity for short-term precipitation forecasting and other advanced use cases. This type of real-time application shows the model’s potential to transform not just climate research but also the way industries, governments, and communities respond to weather events.</p>

<h3>IBM’s Broader Vision for AI and Climate</h3>

<p>IBM's long-standing commitment to AI and climate solutions is evident in its continued partnerships and innovations. This model is part of a broader effort to use AI to address some of the world’s most pressing environmental challenges. As Arjun Shankar of Oak Ridge National Laboratory notes, this collaboration is key to supporting breakthroughs in computational science, a critical component in improving the accuracy of climate models.</p>

<p>With rapid climate change altering weather patterns globally, models like Prithvi WxC are poised to play an increasingly vital role in both understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change. By making advanced AI tools available to the scientific and business communities, IBM and NASA are empowering more stakeholders to engage with climate science and make informed decisions in the face of future risks.</p>

<p>In conclusion, IBM and NASA's release of the Prithvi WxC weather and climate foundation model marks a major milestone in the integration of AI with environmental science. Its open-source availability promises to accelerate innovation across industries and research fields, making advanced weather forecasting and climate modeling more accessible than ever before. With this new tool in the hands of developers and scientists, the future of climate research is looking smarter, faster, and more scalable.
