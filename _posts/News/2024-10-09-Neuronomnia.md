<p><a href='https://neuromnia.com/'>Neuromnia</a> has launched an innovative AI-driven platform leveraging Llama 3.1 to enhance Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy for individuals with <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/autism/data-research/index.html#:~:text=About%201%20in%2036%20children,Read%20Summary%5D'>autism</a>. By automating treatment planning and documentation, Neuromnia aims to improve clinician productivity and access to care while addressing workforce shortages in the ABA industry.</p>

<p>As autism affects one in 36 children, the demand for effective care solutions is higher than ever. Neuromnia is stepping up to meet this challenge by providing clinicians, parents, and teachers with advanced AI tools designed to enhance productivity and improve treatment quality. Their latest development, Nia, is a human-centric AI co-pilot built on <a href='https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/'>Llama 3.1</a>, specifically tailored for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy.</p>

<p>Neuromnia's journey with Llama 3.1 began in May 2024 during the research and testing phase of product development. The team quickly recognized that the 70B model offered the natural language processing capabilities necessary to support their mission. Initially, they utilized Llama to generate behavior intervention plans and skill acquisition recommendations based on client case histories.</p>

<p>Co-Founder & Chief Product Officer Josh Farrow, a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA), played a crucial role in curating a dataset that would help reduce the administrative burden on clinicians. According to Co-Founder & CEO Jay Gupta, “After testing with Llama, we were impressed by its state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing tasks.” This collaboration between clinical expertise and advanced AI technology has enabled Neuromnia to build a comprehensive dataset aimed at improving care delivery.</p>

<p>Open source has been instrumental for startups like Neuromnia in developing scalable solutions without incurring prohibitive costs. The availability of open-source large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3.1 allows teams to leverage community advancements and contributions, refining their capabilities to meet the specific needs of the ABA industry.</p>

<p>Gupta emphasizes that open source empowers them to build and scale their solutions without falling into vendor lock-in traps. The support from the community has proven invaluable for guidance on LLM creation and deployment.</p>

<p>Nia is specifically designed to tackle workforce shortages in the ABA field by automating critical elements of treatment planning, documentation, and modification. By suggesting key treatment components—such as goals and intervention strategies—Nia reduces the time clinicians spend on repetitive tasks, allowing them to manage larger caseloads more efficiently.</p>

<p>The platform also aims to address high burnout and turnover rates among ABA professionals by enhancing productivity through AI-powered capabilities. Gupta notes that many clinics lack robust analytics tools; however, Neuromnia provides automated insights that optimize the entire treatment process from intake to discharge.</p>

<p>With the release of Llama 3.1, Neuromnia has taken Nia’s capabilities to new heights. After resolving initial misconfigurations through trial and error, the team successfully integrated Llama into their platform. Techniques such as prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have been employed to enhance model output quality.</p>

<p>The team has trained the LLM on clinician-created synthetic data to ensure accurate and context-appropriate recommendations within Nia’s software. Gupta explains that while out-of-the-box LLMs can struggle with complex tasks, they have significantly reduced error rates through a combination of fine-tuning and advanced techniques like semantic search.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Neuromnia remains committed to leveraging Llama for ongoing improvements in autism care solutions. They are dedicated to evaluating each new release of Llama to ensure their platform stays cutting-edge and capable of meeting growing demands.</p>

<p>The launch of Neuromnia’s platform represents a significant step forward in autism care by combining advanced AI technology with clinical expertise. By automating key processes within ABA therapy, Neuromnia not only enhances clinician productivity but also improves access to quality care for families affected by autism. As they continue to innovate with Llama, Neuromnia is poised to make a lasting impact on the field of autism support.</p>
