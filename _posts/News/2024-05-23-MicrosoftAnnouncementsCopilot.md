<p>As stated <a href = "https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct/version/2/registry/azureml?tid=c2beb3f8-6ade-48ce-8e7d-6be943f1fbf7#overview">here</a>:

Phi-3 Vision is a lightweight, state-of-the-art open multimodal model built upon datasets which include - synthetic data and filtered publicly available websites - with a focus on very high-quality, reasoning dense data both on text and vision. The model belongs to the Phi-3 model family, and the multimodal version comes with 128K context length (in tokens) it can support. The model underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.</p>

<p>Moving forward, Microsoft has unveiled an ambitious new direction for its laptops, focusing on cutting-edge AI features that require a Neural Processing Unit (NPU). The new Copilot+ PCs badge designates approved AI-ready laptops, currently limited to models with Qualcomm Snapdragon X processors. While these laptops are not yet available, many are expected to hit the market soon.</p>

<p>Microsoft emphasizes efficiency, value, and a new keyboard button as key elements of this new computing wave. This initiative aims to make AI PCs a significant and practical reality, bringing attention to Windows on Arm. As previously speculated, Microsoft is integrating its Copilot AI directly on local computers. Here’s a comprehensive overview of what we know from Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC press conference and prior information. 

Let's take a moment and watch the promotion video created by Microsoft.</p>

<p>So, what do you think about it? Amazed or feeling neutral according to the advancements and given the fact that Apple, Microsoft's rival, used NPU for first time at 2017 and at Microsoft the first usaged is recorded on 2021? Overall, my opinion is that we can get a lot out of this by using it properly. The future is exciting and I can't wait to see what may come!</p>
