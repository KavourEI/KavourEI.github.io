<p>Anthropic has introduced the <a href='https://www.anthropic.com/economic-index'>Anthropic Economic Index</a>, a pioneering initiative aimed at analyzing AI's influence on labor markets and the broader economy. This inaugural report offers unprecedented insights into how AI is being integrated into various occupational tasks, based on extensive data from millions of anonymized interactions with Claude.ai.</p>

<p>In February 2025, Anthropic launched the Anthropic Economic Index, an initiative designed to monitor and understand the evolving impact of artificial intelligence on labor markets and the economy. This effort is grounded in the analysis of millions of anonymized conversations with <a href='http://claude.ai/'>Claude.ai</a>, providing a unique perspective on AI's real-world applications across diverse professional sectors.</p> 

<p>The initial findings of the Index reveal that AI usage is predominantly concentrated in software development and technical writing tasks. Notably, over one-third of occupations (approximately 36%) incorporate AI in at least a quarter of their associated tasks, while about 4% of occupations utilize AI in three-quarters of their tasks. This indicates a significant, though varied, integration of AI into modern workflows.</p> 

<p>Furthermore, the data suggests that AI is more commonly employed for augmentation purposes—enhancing and collaborating with human capabilities—rather than for automation. Specifically, 57% of AI applications are aimed at augmenting human tasks, whereas 43% are focused on automating tasks. This trend underscores AI's role as a supportive tool that amplifies human productivity and creativity.</p> 

<p>AI adoption appears to be more prevalent in mid-to-high wage occupations, such as computer programmers and data scientists. Conversely, both the lowest and highest-paid roles exhibit lower levels of AI integration. This pattern likely reflects the current limitations of AI technologies and practical challenges associated with their implementation in certain job categories.</p> 

<p>To facilitate further research and policy development, Anthropic has <a href='https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/EconomicIndex/'>open-sourced the dataset</a> underpinning this analysis. By inviting economists, policy experts, and researchers to engage with the data, Anthropic aims to foster a collaborative approach to understanding and addressing the transformative effects of AI on employment and productivity.</p> 

<p>This comprehensive analysis builds upon existing economic research by focusing on occupational tasks rather than entire professions. Recognizing that many jobs share common tasks and skills, this approach provides a nuanced understanding of how AI is selectively adopted across different functions and industries.</p> 

<p>The research leverages <a href='https://www.anthropic.com/research/clio'>Clio</a>, an automated tool developed by Anthropic, to analyze conversations with Claude.ai while ensuring user privacy. By mapping these interactions to specific occupational tasks, classified according to the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Information Network (<a href='https://www.onetonline.org/'>O*NET</a>), the study offers a detailed examination of AI's role in the contemporary workforce.</p> 

<p>In summary, the Anthropic Economic Index serves as a vital resource for comprehending AI's current and potential impact on labor markets. By providing empirical data and fostering an open dialogue among stakeholders, this initiative aims to inform policy decisions and guide the responsible integration of AI into various economic sectors.
