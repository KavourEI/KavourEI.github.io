This makes it easier for creators to bring new ideas to life without needing advanced video editing skills.</p></li>

<p>With the Video-to-Video tool, users can apply different visual styles to their footage, allowing for experimentation with a wide range of aesthetics. From retro film grain to futuristic sci-fi looks, this feature enhances the creative flexibility of video projects, offering a quick way to change the entire atmosphere of a video.</p></li>

<li> <strong>Weather and Lighting Adjustments</strong>
<p>Runway’s new tool goes beyond basic editing by enabling users to adjust environmental conditions in their videos. Creators can introduce elements like rain, snow, or even change the time of day within a scene. This opens up exciting new storytelling possibilities, allowing users to craft dynamic and engaging content with just a few clicks.</p></li>

<li> <strong>Object Manipulation</strong>
<p>For content creators looking to enhance their videos with special effects or product placements, the Video-to-Video feature enables precise manipulation of objects within a frame. This includes adding, removing, or altering objects—ideal for fixing continuity issues, introducing new elements, or customizing the visual narrative of a project.</p></li>
