<p>Linear programming (LP) has been a cornerstone of optimization across various industries for decades, but traditional methods face challenges when applied to large-scale problems. PDLP, a groundbreaking first-order method-based solver, overcomes these limitations by offering improved scalability and efficiency, making it a powerful tool for solving complex LP tasks.</p>

<p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming'>Linear programming</a> (LP) problems has long been a fundamental component of optimization in numerous industries, including manufacturing, networking, and logistics. Since its inception in the 1940s, methods like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm">simplex algorithm</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior-point_method">interior-point</a> techniques have been widely used but face challenges in scaling to larger problems. PDLP (Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Enhanced for LP) is an innovative solver that addresses these limitations. Developed since 2018 and recently awarded the Beale–Orchard-Hays Prize, PDLP offers a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:First_order_methods">first-order</a> method (FOM) based approach that excels at large-scale linear programming tasks.</p>

<p>Traditional LP solvers often struggle with memory and hardware-related challenges, particularly when faced with large problem sizes. These issues arise due to the reliance on matrix factorizations, which demand significant memory and are incompatible with modern computational technologies such as GPUs and distributed systems. PDLP, however, utilizes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication#Definitions">matrix-vector multiplication</a>, which reduces memory requirements and enhances computational scalability. Built on the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10851-010-0251-1">primal-dual hybrid gradient</a> (PDHG) algorithm, PDLP improves its reliability through adaptive restarts, preconditioning, and step-size adjustments. These enhancements allow it to converge faster and more efficiently, making it ideal for solving large-scale LP problems.</p>

<p>PDLP is a game-changer for computational optimization, enabling faster and more scalable LP solving across a variety of applications. Whether optimizing network traffic in Google’s data centers or solving the massive Traveling Salesman Problem, PDLP pushes the boundaries of what is achievable in the field. Its open-source nature and growing adoption in both academic and commercial settings reflect its potential for broader impact, paving the way for new innovations in optimization technologies.</p>
