<p> ElevenLabs has enhanced its ElevenReader app with GenFM, enabling users to generate personalized podcasts from various text formats, thereby revolutionizing the way people consume written content.</p>

<p>The digital age has transformed how we access and consume information, and with the advent of artificial intelligence, this evolution is accelerating. ElevenLabs has taken a significant step forward by launching the <strong>GenFM feature</strong> within its <a href='https://elevenlabs.io/text-reader'>ElevenReader app</a>. This innovative addition allows users to create smart personal podcasts from PDFs, articles, ebooks, and more, making it easier than ever to absorb information on the go. This article explores the features of GenFM, its implications for content consumption, and how it enhances the overall user experience within the ElevenReader app.</p>

<p>The ElevenReader app is a versatile tool that transforms written text into high-quality audio using advanced AI voice technology. Available for free on both iOS and Android platforms, it supports 32 languages and provides natural-sounding narration. Users can listen to any text they choose, whether it's a document, article, or ebook, making reading more accessible and convenient.</p>

<p>With the introduction of GenFM, ElevenReader takes a giant leap forward in personalizing the reading experience. This feature allows users to generate podcasts that adapt to the most relevant ideas and insights from their reading materials.
