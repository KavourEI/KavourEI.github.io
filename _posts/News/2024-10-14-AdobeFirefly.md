<p>On October 14, 2024, during Adobe MAX, the world’s largest creativity conference, Adobe announced the launch of the Firefly Video Model (beta). This model marks a significant expansion of Adobe's Firefly family of generative AI models, which has already gained traction in image generation since its initial release. With over 13 billion images generated since March 2023, the Firefly suite is rapidly becoming a go-to resource for creative professionals.</p>

<p>The Firefly Video Model is the first publicly available video model explicitly designed to be safe for commercial use. This innovative tool allows creators to generate and edit video content efficiently while ensuring compliance with licensing and copyright considerations. As part of its beta launch, Adobe is gathering feedback from a select group of creative professionals to refine the model further.</p>

<p>The Firefly Video Model includes several standout features that enhance its functionality. The <strong><a href='https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/10/14/generative-extend-in-premiere-pro'>Generative Extend</a></strong> feature allows users to seamlessly extend video clips, filling gaps in footage and smoothing transitions within Adobe Premiere Pro. Additionally, users can generate videos directly from text prompts with controls for camera angles and motion through the <strong>Text to Video</strong> feature. The <strong>Image to Video</strong> capability enables creators to transform still images or illustrations into dynamic video clips, adding a new dimension to their visual storytelling. Furthermore, the latest Firefly Image 3 model offers image generation that is up to four times faster than previous iterations, while the <strong>Generative Workspace in <a href='https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/10/14/photoshop-delivers-powerful-innovation-for-image-editing-ideation-3d-design-more'>Photoshop</a></strong> fosters creativity and collaboration by enabling designers to brainstorm and iterate concepts quickly.</p>

<p>The Firefly Video Model integrates seamlessly with various Adobe applications including Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro. This integration enhances workflows by allowing users to leverage generative AI capabilities across different platforms. For instance, the Generative Shape Fill and Text to Pattern features in Illustrator empower designers to create unique artwork rapidly.</p>

<p>Adobe also introduced new offerings aimed at enterprises through Firefly Services. These include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><a href='https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/10/14/oliver-supercharges-its-ai-content-creation-with-help-from-adobe-firefly-services'>Dubbing and Lip Sync</a>:</strong> This feature uses generative AI to translate spoken dialogue into multiple languages while maintaining the original voice's sound and lip movements.</li>
    <li><strong>Bulk Create:</strong> Aimed at enhancing efficiency, this tool allows creative professionals to edit large volumes of images quickly, streamlining tasks such as resizing and background removal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Leading brands like PepsiCo/Gatorade, IBM, Mattel, and Deloitte have already utilized Adobe Firefly to optimize their workflows and scale content creation. By automating repetitive tasks, these companies can focus more on exploring their creative visions rather than getting bogged down by technical details.</p>

<p>Adobe emphasizes responsible innovation through its <a href='https://www.adobe.com/ai/overview/ethics.html'>AI Ethics principles—accountability</a>, responsibility, and transparency. The company has trained its Firefly models on licensed content from Adobe Stock and public domain sources. Furthermore, Adobe promotes Content Credentials as a standard for transparency in digital content creation, allowing users to understand how content was generated or modified.</p>

<p>The Firefly Video Model is currently available in a limited public beta at firefly.adobe.com (there is a waiting list <a href='https://www.adobe.com/products/firefly/features/ai-video-generator.html'>here</a>). During this phase, generations are free of charge. Adobe plans to provide additional information regarding pricing and offers once the model moves beyond beta testing.</p>

<p>The launch of the Firefly Video Model represents a significant leap forward in generative AI tools for creative professionals. By integrating advanced video capabilities into its existing suite of applications, Adobe is empowering users to create high-quality content more efficiently than ever before. As feedback from the beta phase rolls in, Adobe aims to refine these tools further, solidifying its position as a leader in creative technology.</p>
