<p> The latest additions to Microsoft's Phi family of small language models (SLMs) was <a href='https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/empowering-innovation-the-next-generation-of-the-phi-family/'>announced</a>, introducing Phi-4-multimodal and Phi-4-mini. These models are designed to enhance AI capabilities across various applications, offering developers advanced tools for innovation. </p>
  
<p>In its ongoing commitment to advancing artificial intelligence, Microsoft has announced two new models in its Phi family of small language models (SLMs): Phi-4-multimodal and Phi-4-mini. These models are engineered to provide developers with sophisticated AI tools, facilitating the creation of innovative and context-aware applications. </p>
  
<p>Phi-4-multimodal stands out with its ability to process speech, vision, and text simultaneously. This multimodal capability opens new avenues for developing applications that require a comprehensive understanding of diverse data types, enabling more nuanced and effective AI solutions. </p>
