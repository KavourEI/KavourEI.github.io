<p> <a href='https://www.together.ai/'>Together AI</a>, a leading AI acceleration cloud, is transforming the way developers and businesses design, develop, and manage generative AI applications. By focusing on open-source models like <a href='https://www.llama.com/'>Llama</a>, Together AI is enabling developers to seamlessly navigate the entire AI lifecycle with tools that are both accessible and powerful. With the launch of innovative applications like <a href='https://llamacoder.together.ai/'>LlamaCoder</a>, the company continues to push the boundaries of what open-source generative AI can achieve.</p>

<p>To inspire developers working with Llama models, Together AI created LlamaCoder, an open-source web application that generates full applications from simple text prompts using the Llama 3.1 405B model. Since its release, LlamaCoder has gained rapid popularity, with more than 200,000 apps generated and over 2,000 GitHub stars. This success highlights the potential of Llama 3.1 405B, the first open-source model to excel at coding-based use cases. Developers have used LlamaCoder to create a range of applications, including quiz apps, pomodoro timers, and budgeting tools, demonstrating the model’s versatility and power.</p>

<p>In addition to LlamaCoder, Together AI has also developed other example apps using Llama 3.1, such as <a href='https://llamatutor.together.ai/'>LlamaTutor</a> for learning and <a href='https://www.turboseek.io/'>TurboSeek</a>, an AI-powered search engine. These applications showcase the extensive capabilities of the Llama models, which rival closed-source models while maintaining robust safety features for responsible development.</p>
