<p>YouTube is introducing <a href='https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/made-on-youtube-2024'>Dream Screen</a>, a new feature that allows creators to generate dynamic video content for Shorts using two advanced AI modelsâ€”<a href='https://deepmind.google/technologies/veo/'>Veo</a> and <a href='https://deepmind.google/technologies/imagen-3/'>Imagen 3</a>. These models, built upon Google's decade-long innovation in <a href='https://research.google/blog/transformer-a-novel-neural-network-architecture-for-language-understanding/'>Transformer architecture</a> and diffusion models, have been refined for large-scale use. Dream Screen allows creators to input text prompts, generating four distinct images from which they can choose their preferred visual style. From there, Veo transforms the selected image into a high-quality, six-second video clip. These AI-generated video clips will initially be available for use as backgrounds, with standalone six-second video generation rolling out in 2025.</p>

<p>By launching these generative AI tools, YouTube is enhancing creative possibilities for its vast user base. The company hopes these innovations will inspire creators to bring their ideas to life in vivid and transformative ways. In addition to ensuring accessibility, YouTube is committed to transparency by labeling AI-generated content with watermarks and notifications. These advancements mark a significant step forward in democratizing creativity, empowering creators globally to push the boundaries of their imagination.
