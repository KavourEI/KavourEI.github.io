<h3>The Evolution of Image Segmentation</h3>

<p>Image segmentation, the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments to simplify or change its representation, is a fundamental task in computer vision. It has applications ranging from medical imaging to autonomous driving. Traditional methods have often struggled with accuracy and efficiency, especially in complex scenarios. SAM2, however, leverages advanced AI to overcome these challenges and deliver state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>As Mark Zuckerberg <a href='https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/'>noted</a> in an open letter last week, open source AI “has more potential than any other modern technology to increase human productivity, creativity, and quality of life,” all while accelerating economic growth and advancing groundbreaking medical and scientific research. We’ve been tremendously impressed by the progress the AI community has made using SAM, and we envisage SAM 2 unlocking even more exciting possibilities.</p>
