<p> <a href='https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/ai-workflows/'>NVIDIA's NIM Agent Blueprints</a> empower enterprises to build and deploy customized generative AI applications, driving business transformation and innovation across industries.</p>

<p> The generative AI landscape is evolving rapidly, moving from simple tools for content creation to sophisticated, enterprise-level applications powered by advanced open-source models like Google Gemma, Llama 3.1, and Microsoft Phi. The introduction of NVIDIA's NIM Agent Blueprints marks a significant step forward in this transformation, offering enterprises a comprehensive toolkit to develop customized AI applications that drive business growth and efficiency.</p>

<p> NVIDIA’s NIM Agent Blueprints are tailored AI workflows designed for specific business use cases, such as customer service chatbots, drug discovery, and enterprise data extraction. These blueprints provide developers with reference applications, code, and documentation, making it easier to build and deploy generative AI solutions. Importantly, the blueprints are not static; they enable continuous improvement through data-driven feedback loops, enhancing AI models over time.</p>

<p> The impact of NIM Agent Blueprints extends across industries, enabling enterprises to integrate AI into their workflows with greater ease and efficiency. Companies like ServiceNow are already leveraging these tools to enhance their digital platforms, driving significant AI-driven transformation. NVIDIA’s extensive ecosystem, including partners like Accenture, Deloitte, and global cloud providers, supports the deployment and optimization of these blueprints, ensuring they are scalable and effective across various business environments.</p>

<p> The first NIM Agent Blueprints available are:
<ul>
<li> digital human for customer service</li>
<li> generative virtual screening for accelerated drug discovery</li>
<li> multimodal PDF data extraction for enterprise RAG</li>
</ul></p>

<p> As generative AI continues to advance, the collaboration between developers and data scientists becomes increasingly vital. NIM Agent Blueprints facilitate this collaboration, enabling teams to build, refine, and scale AI applications that not only meet today’s business needs but also adapt to future challenges. With continuous updates and a robust support network, NVIDIA’s NIM Agent Blueprints are set to become a cornerstone in the next phase of enterprise AI innovation, helping companies across the globe harness the full potential of generative AI.</p>
