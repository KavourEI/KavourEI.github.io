<p> It has been announced that Grok AI model has expanded to Europe. </p> 

<p> For me Grok was not a well known AI chatbot. Was it because I live in Europe, was it because I didn't catch the announcements?!? I don't know. I will assume the same for you. As a result, let us first asnwer to the question what is Grok.</p>

<p> As it is stated <a href="https://x.ai/blog/grok">here</a> <i>"Grok is an AI modeled after the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. It is intended to answer almost anything and, far harder, even suggest what questions to ask!</i>". So Grok is an AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk's company xAI. By searching around, you can find out that Grok can access real-time information through social media platform X, which is kinda expected if you think who the owner is, and is said to answer "spicy" questions typically regected by most other AI systems. It can be accessed through a premium + X subscription. </p>

<p> xAI says that Grok is able to respond to questions that most other chatbots would refuse, no matter the size of the risk. We can take a look at the shared <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1720643054065873124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1720643054065873124%7Ctwgr%5E7dcd667d00c687e5ff639f666b649cd9da8e7619%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-1606052890471219633.ampproject.net%2F2401262004000%2Fframe.html">screenshot</a> of Grok that is willing to provide a step-by-step guide to making cocaine for so-said <i>"developmental purposes"</i>. In a previous post, Elon Musk posts, <i>xAI's Grok system is designed to have a little humor in its responses</i> and we can see in the "developemental post" that is stated <i>"start cooking and hope you don't blow yourself up or get arrested."</i>. There are plently of such examples and cases, if you are willing to search around. Getting deeper into topic is not in the scope of this post.</p>
