        <title>Jingle or No Jingle. A Hilariously Serious Dive into PyTorch Image Classification for Santa Claus Detection. ðŸŽ„</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt; Season's Greetings, data scientists and tech enthusiasts! In the spirit of ho-ho-hilarity and cutting-edge Christmas cheer, I present to you a Christmas-themed trip into the world of PyTorch image classification. Armed with the power of pixels and powered by the magic of MacOS, this jolly project endeavors to answer the age-old question: Is Santa Claus photo bombing your holiday snapshots? Join me on this merry adventure and get ready for a sleigh ride through code, Christmas spirit, and a dash of high-tech merriment! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Before we dive into the jingle of PyTorch and the festive magic of image classification, let's address the elephant in the room â€“ a.k.a. the neural network. If you're already familiar with the ins and outs of neural networks, fantastic! If not, take a brief pause and explore the basics in this &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;introductory post&lt;/a&gt;. Fear not! I won't be unwrapping the intricacies of neural network structures here. Instead, we're keeping it as simple as Santa's route to your chimney, because after all, his visit is just around the corner! &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Uncovering Topics in BBC News with Latent Dirichlet Allocation in R</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt; Welcome everyone! Keeping in mind the post about Latent Dirichlet Allocation (in case you have not read it yet and you are interested, you can read it &lt;a href=&quot;/the-editor/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), I am going explore the computational part with you on a dataset containing BBC News (you can find the corresponding data &lt;a href=&quot;/the-editor/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). With the assistance of R-programming language, we are going to find an optimal number of topics, in which we can cluster BBC News and tidy the archived collection of BBC News we have in our dataset. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Topic Modelling - Latent Dirichlet Allocation</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt; Hello everyone! In this post I am going to go through an NLP subject. As you may have already read in this post's title, Topic Modelling is what I aim to explain to you as simple as possible. The reason for creating this post is due to the fact that I have searched around and it took me quite a while to find a non academic explanation of this subject, and I had to combine multiple sources to clearly understand what is going on with that topic. As a result, here I aim to gather all the information I found useful and try to explain everything as non-academic as possible. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Neural Network ~ Predicting a Numerical Value</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome back! As part of this introductory series on Neural Networks, we will be exploring the process of building NNs and making decisions about their topology. This includes determining the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, selecting appropriate activation functions, and implementing backpropagation. Throughout this process, we will delve into various factors to consider when building an effective neural network. Though everything is statistics (ðŸ˜‰) I will try to keep statistical formulas to the minimum possible level.&lt;/p&gt;
