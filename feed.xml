&lt;p&gt; To enhance the reasoning capabilities of off-the-shelf Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a simple, yet general and effective prompting method, Re2, i.e., &lt;strong&gt;Re&lt;/strong&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Re&lt;/strong&gt;ading the question as input. Unlike most thought-eliciting prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which aim to elicit the reasoning process in the output, Re2 shifts the focus to the input by processing questions twice, thereby enhancing the understanding process. Consequently, Re2 demonstrates strong generality and compatibility with most thought-eliciting prompting methods, including CoT. Crucially, Re2 facilitates a &quot;bidirectional&quot; encoding in unidirectional decoder-only LLMs because the first pass could provide global information for the second pass. We begin with a preliminary empirical study as the foundation of Re2, illustrating its potential to enable &quot;bidirectional&quot; attention mechanisms. We then evaluate Re2 on extensive reasoning benchmarks across 14 datasets, spanning 112 experiments, to validate its effectiveness and generality. Our findings indicate that, with the exception of a few scenarios on vanilla ChatGPT, Re2 consistently enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs through a simple re-reading strategy. Further analyses reveal Re2's adaptability, showing how it can be effectively integrated with different LLMs, thought-eliciting prompting, and ensemble strategies.

PDLP, a groundbreaking first-order method-based solver, overcomes these limitations by offering improved scalability and efficiency, making it a powerful tool for solving complex LP tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming&quot;&gt;Linear programming&lt;/a&gt; (LP) problems has long been a fundamental component of optimization in numerous industries, including manufacturing, networking, and logistics. Since its inception in the 1940s, methods like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm&quot;&gt;simplex algorithm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior-point_method&quot;&gt;interior-point&lt;/a&gt; techniques have been widely used but face challenges in scaling to larger problems. PDLP (Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Enhanced for LP) is an innovative solver that addresses these limitations. Developed since 2018 and recently awarded the Beale–Orchard-Hays Prize, PDLP offers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:First_order_methods&quot;&gt;first-order&lt;/a&gt; method (FOM) based approach that excels at large-scale linear programming tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional LP solvers often struggle with memory and hardware-related challenges, particularly when faced with large problem sizes. These issues arise due to the reliance on matrix factorizations, which demand significant memory and are incompatible with modern computational technologies such as GPUs and distributed systems. PDLP, however, utilizes &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication#Definitions&quot;&gt;matrix-vector multiplication&lt;/a&gt;, which reduces memory requirements and enhances computational scalability. Built on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10851-010-0251-1&quot;&gt;primal-dual hybrid gradient&lt;/a&gt; (PDHG) algorithm, PDLP improves its reliability through adaptive restarts, preconditioning, and step-size adjustments. These enhancements allow it to converge faster and more efficiently, making it ideal for solving large-scale LP problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PDLP is a game-changer for computational optimization, enabling faster and more scalable LP solving across a variety of applications. Whether optimizing network traffic in Google’s data centers or solving the massive Traveling Salesman Problem, PDLP pushes the boundaries of what is achievable in the field. Its open-source nature and growing adoption in both academic and commercial settings reflect its potential for broader impact, paving the way for new innovations in optimization technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Our work examines the efficacy of employing advanced machine learning methods to solve captchas from Google's reCAPTCHAv2 system. We evaluate the effectiveness of automated systems in solving captchas by utilizing advanced YOLO models for image segmentation and classification. Our main result is that we can solve 100% of the captchas, while previous work only solved 68-71%. Furthermore, our findings suggest that there is no significant difference in the number of challenges humans and bots must solve to pass the captchas in reCAPTCHAv2. This implies that current AI technologies can exploit advanced image-based captchas. We also look under the hood of reCAPTCHAv2, and find evidence that reCAPTCHAv2 is heavily based on cookie and browser history data when evaluating whether a user is human or not. The code is provided alongside this paper.&lt;/p&gt;

Designed to excel in complex reasoning tasks, the o1 model has achieved remarkable results in competitive programming, academic benchmarks, and real-world applications. This article explores the cutting-edge capabilities of o1, from its performance in math and science challenges to its proficiency in coding and human-like reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Power of o1: Breaking Benchmarks and Rivaling Experts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI's o1 model outperforms its predecessors and rivals human experts in various fields, particularly in reasoning-heavy tasks. In math, for instance, o1 solved 74% of problems from the prestigious AIME exam, placing it among the top 500 high school students in the U.S. With additional techniques like consensus sampling and re-ranking, its accuracy reached an impressive 93%. This is a significant improvement over earlier models like GPT-4o, which only solved 12% of the same problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.ctfassets.net/kftzwdyauwt9/7rMY55vLbGTlTiP9GdSOrf/0944e1cde904e896bc5bc6f3da7f16b6/compute-dark.png?w=3840&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;fm=webp&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;o1 performance smoothly improves with both train-time and test-time compute&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In science, o1 excelled on the GPQA diamond benchmark, designed to test advanced knowledge in chemistry, physics, and biology. When compared to PhD experts, o1 surpassed their performance, becoming the first AI model to do so on this difficult test. However, OpenAI clarifies that o1’s results &lt;strong&gt;do not imply&lt;/strong&gt; it is superior to PhDs across the board, but it does outshine them in certain types of problem-solving and that it is expected to solve some problems that a PhD would be expected to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model’s coding abilities are equally impressive. In the 2024 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), o1 ranked in the 49th percentile among human competitors. When relaxed constraints allowed for 10,000 submissions per problem, the model scored above the gold medal threshold, showcasing its problem-solving agility in algorithmic challenges. Additionally, in simulated programming contests on Codeforces, o1 achieved an Elo rating of 1807, outperforming 93% of human participants, a remarkable feat in competitive programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;o1 improves over GPT-4o on a wide range of benchmarks, including 54/57 MMLU subcategories. Seven are shown for illustration.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Reinforcement Learning and Chain of Thought: The Key to o1's Success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central to o1's reasoning advancements is its ability to leverage a &lt;i&gt;&quot;chain of thought&quot;&lt;/i&gt; process, similar to how humans think through complex problems. This process allows the model to break down difficult questions, refine its approaches, and correct mistakes over time. Reinforcement learning plays a crucial role in this, teaching the model how to think productively, which leads to consistent improvements in both training and test-time performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &quot;chain of thought&quot; approach significantly improves the model's reasoning capabilities across tasks such as math, data analysis, and programming. For example, in open-ended evaluations, human trainers consistently preferred o1's responses over GPT-4o in areas that required deep reasoning. However, o1 is not perfect in all domains, as it struggled with some natural language tasks, suggesting it may not yet be universally applicable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Safety and Alignment: A Responsible Approach to AI Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safety is a critical consideration in AI development, and OpenAI has integrated safety principles into o1’s chain of thought reasoning. By teaching the model safety rules and embedding these principles into its reasoning process, o1 has shown increased robustness in safety evaluations. It performed exceptionally well in tests designed to assess its resistance to harmful outputs, surpassing previous models like GPT-4o.&lt;/p&gt;

However, these models sometimes produce inaccurate information with confidence, a phenomenon known as &quot;hallucination.&quot; Addressing this issue is critical for enhancing AI reliability. Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/gemma&quot;&gt;DataGemma&lt;/a&gt;, the first open model designed to reduce hallucinations by grounding LLMs in real-world statistical data from Google’s vast &lt;a href=&quot;https://datacommons.org/&quot;&gt;Data Commons&lt;/a&gt;. This article explores how DataGemma leverages the power of trusted data sources to improve the factual accuracy and reasoning of LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Challenges of Hallucination in AI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As AI models grow more advanced, they demonstrate remarkable capabilities in various domains. They can sift through extensive text databases, generate creative ideas, and even draft software code. Yet, despite their strengths, they are prone to hallucinations—generating outputs that are either partially or entirely incorrect. This challenge is particularly problematic when AI models are used in fields requiring high accuracy, such as research, policymaking, and data analysis. For AI to become a more dependable tool, it must consistently provide accurate information grounded in verifiable facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introducing DataGemma and Data Commons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DataGemma is Google’s innovative solution to the hallucination problem. It works by connecting LLMs to the Data Commons, a public knowledge graph filled with over 240 billion data points across numerous statistical variables. This data is sourced from reputable organizations like the United Nations (UN), World Health Organization (WHO), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The wealth of reliable information within Data Commons spans topics like health, economics, demographics, and environmental trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By integrating Data Commons, DataGemma ensures that LLMs can access real-world, trustworthy data during their response generation process. This connection allows AI systems to verify statistical claims, reducing the likelihood of hallucinations and improving the overall factual accuracy of the responses generated by models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Grounding LLMs with DataGemma: RIG and RAG Approaches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DataGemma employs two primary techniques to mitigate hallucinations: RIG (Retrieval-Interleaved Generation) and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;a href=https://colab.research.google.com/github/datacommonsorg/llm-tools/blob/master/notebooks/datagemma_rig.ipynb'&amp;gt;RIG&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (Retrieval-Interleaved Generation) – This method allows models to proactively query trusted sources, such as Data Commons, during the response generation process. If the model encounters a statistical query or data-related prompt, it retrieves accurate information from Data Commons before finalizing its response. This proactive retrieval helps the model fact-check its output, greatly minimizing the chances of hallucinating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://colab.research.google.com/github/datacommonsorg/llm-tools/blob/master/notebooks/datagemma_rag.ipynb&quot;&gt;RAG&lt;/a&gt; (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) – RAG enables LLMs to go beyond their initial training data, pulling in additional contextual information from external sources. In the case of DataGemma, the model utilizes a long context window to retrieve relevant information from Data Commons before generating a response. By doing so, DataGemma enhances the depth and accuracy of responses, offering more informed insights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preliminary &lt;a href=&quot;http://datacommons.org/link/DataGemmaPaper&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that these techniques significantly reduce hallucinations, especially when handling numerical facts. Early tests have shown promising results, suggesting that users across research, decision-making, and curiosity-driven explorations will experience more reliable interactions with AI models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch of DataGemma marks a significant advancement in addressing the issue of hallucination in large language models. By connecting AI to the rich, real-world data housed in Google’s Data Commons, DataGemma offers a pathway to more reliable and factually grounded AI outputs. The integration of retrieval techniques like RIG and RAG demonstrates how LLMs can be anchored in trustworthy data, making them more dependable for users across industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the technology continues to evolve, the improvements seen in DataGemma are a crucial step toward making AI not only more sophisticated but also more accurate and trustworthy. By ensuring that AI provides factual and context-rich information, we are closer to building a future where these models become indispensable tools for informed decision-making and deeper understanding of the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Kavour</name></author><category term="news" /><summary type="html">Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the AI landscape by providing powerful tools for generating human-like text, answering complex questions, and assisting with tasks like summarization and code generation.
