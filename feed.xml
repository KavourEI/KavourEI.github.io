&lt;p&gt; Researchers are investing substantial effort in developing powerful general-purpose agents, wherein Foundation Models are used as modules within agentic systems (e.g. Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, Toolformer). However, the history of machine learning teaches us that hand-designed solutions are eventually replaced by learned solutions. We formulate a new research area, Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS), which aims to automatically create powerful agentic system designs, including inventing novel building blocks and/or combining them in new ways. We further demonstrate that there is an unexplored yet promising approach within ADAS where agents can be defined in code and new agents can be automatically discovered by a meta agent programming ever better ones in code. Given that programming languages are Turing Complete, this approach theoretically enables the learning of any possible agentic system: including novel prompts, tool use, control flows, and combinations thereof. We present a simple yet effective algorithm named Meta Agent Search to demonstrate this idea, where a meta agent iteratively programs interesting new agents based on an ever-growing archive of previous discoveries. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains including coding, science, and math, we show that our algorithm can progressively invent agents with novel designs that greatly outperform state-of-the-art hand-designed agents. Importantly, we consistently observe the surprising result that agents invented by Meta Agent Search maintain superior performance even when transferred across domains and models, demonstrating their robustness and generality. Provided we develop it safely, our work illustrates the potential of an exciting new research direction toward automatically designing ever-more powerful agentic systems to benefit humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As AI models grow increasingly complex, optimizing their performance without sacrificing accuracy becomes essential. NVIDIA's latest blog post provides an insightful guide on how to prune and distill the LLaMA 3.1 8B model to create the more efficient Minitron 4B model following the same steps presented in their research's team &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14679&quot;&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt;. This process not only reduces the model's size but also maintains its performance, making it more suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. In this article, we explore the key steps and techniques outlined by NVIDIA to achieve this optimization.

&lt;h3&gt;Understanding Pruning and Distillation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of NVIDIA's approach, described in the original &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/how-to-prune-and-distill-llama-3-1-8b-to-an-nvidia-llama-3-1-minitron-4b-model/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, lies in two critical techniques: pruning and distillation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Pruning&lt;/strong&gt;, involves removing less important neurons and connections from the model, thereby reducing its size without significantly affecting its accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Distillation&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, transfers knowledge from the larger, more complex model (LLaMA 3.1 8B) to a smaller model (Minitron 4B), ensuring that the smaller model retains the essential features and capabilities of the original.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Together, these processes enable the creation of a more efficient model that can perform well in various real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Step-by-Step Pruning Process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA’s blog details the step-by-step process for pruning the LLaMA 3.1 8B model. The process begins with identifying and ranking the neurons and connections based on their contribution to the model's overall performance. NVIDIA recommends using techniques like magnitude-based pruning, which removes connections with the smallest weights, and structured pruning, which eliminates entire neurons or filters. This selective reduction helps in minimizing the impact on model accuracy while significantly reducing the number of parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Effective Knowledge Distillation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After pruning, the next critical step is knowledge distillation. NVIDIA explains how to train the Minitron 4B model by leveraging the knowledge from the pruned LLaMA 3.1 8B model. This involves using the outputs of the larger model as a guide for training the smaller model, ensuring that the Minitron 4B model mimics the behavior of the original as closely as possible. Techniques like soft targets, where the probability distribution over possible outputs is used instead of hard labels, are emphasized to capture the nuances of the larger model's decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Balancing Performance and Efficiency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main challenges in pruning and distillation is balancing the trade-off between performance and efficiency. NVIDIA’s approach focuses on maintaining a high level of accuracy while reducing the model's size and computational requirements. The blog outlines strategies for fine-tuning the pruned and distilled model, such as iterative pruning and distillation cycles, to gradually refine the model’s performance. This ensures that the final Minitron 4B model is not only smaller and faster but also highly effective in its tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Deployment and Real-World Applications&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pruned and distilled Minitron 4B model is particularly suited for deployment in environments where computational resources are limited, such as edge devices and mobile platforms. Based on the studdies that have been carried out &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14679&quot;&gt;Compact Language Models via Pruning and Knowledge Distillation&lt;/a&gt;, NVIDIA highlights various real-world applications where the Minitron 4B model can be effectively utilized, including natural language processing, computer vision, and autonomous systems. By reducing the model’s footprint, it becomes easier to deploy AI solutions in scenarios that require quick, efficient processing without access to large-scale computing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To facilitate the pruning and distillation process, NVIDIA provides a range of tools and resources. The blog mentions specific libraries and frameworks, such as TensorRT, that are optimized for model pruning and distillation. Additionally, NVIDIA offers pre-configured environments and detailed documentation to help developers implement these techniques with ease. This support underscores NVIDIA’s commitment to making advanced AI accessible and efficient for a broader range of users and applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA’s guide on pruning and distilling the LLaMA 3.1 8B model to create the Minitron 4B model demonstrates the potential of optimizing AI models for efficiency without compromising on performance. By leveraging advanced techniques like pruning and knowledge distillation, developers can create smaller, faster models that are well-suited for deployment in various real-world scenarios. NVIDIA’s comprehensive approach, supported by its robust tools and resources, provides a valuable blueprint for anyone looking to enhance their AI models' efficiency, making cutting-edge AI more accessible and applicable across diverse industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; California's SB 1047, a bill originally designed to prevent AI-related disasters, has undergone significant changes following opposition from key players in Silicon Valley, including AI firm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com&quot;&gt;Anthropic&lt;/a&gt;. The bill, now passed by the Appropriations Committee, has been softened to address concerns from the AI industry while still aiming to hold developers liable for AI models that cause catastrophic events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; Key Amendments and Their Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; One of the most critical amendments removes the power of California’s attorney general to sue AI companies for negligent safety practices before a disaster occurs. This change, proposed by Anthropic, instead allows the attorney general to seek injunctive relief or sue after a catastrophe. This amendment significantly reduces the preemptive power of the state in regulating AI safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Another significant change is the elimination of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/techne/regulating-frontier-models-in-ai/&quot;&gt;Frontier Model Division (FMD)&lt;/a&gt;, a proposed new government agency, from the bill. Instead, the responsibilities of the FMD are transferred to a newly expanded Board of Frontier Models within the Government Operations Agency. This board will be responsible for setting compute thresholds, issuing safety guidance, and establishing regulations for auditors, but its role is now more integrated into existing governmental structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Further amendments include a relaxation of liability measures for AI developers. AI labs are no longer required to submit safety test results under penalty of perjury, reducing the legal risks for these companies. The bill now asks developers to provide &quot;reasonable care&quot; instead of &quot;reasonable assurance&quot; that their AI models do not pose significant risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Additionally, the bill offers protections for open-source AI development. Developers who spend less than $10 million fine-tuning a model are not considered liable under SB 1047, shifting the responsibility to the original developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; Reactions and Future Prospects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The changes have sparked mixed reactions. While these amendments are seen as a way to ease industry concerns and make the bill more palatable for Governor Newsom's approval, they have not fully satisfied critics. Some argue that the revisions are superficial and fail to address deeper issues, with some U.S. Congress members even urging a veto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Despite these criticisms, SB 1047 is moving forward and is now headed to the California Assembly for a final vote. If passed, it will return to the Senate due to the amendments before potentially landing on Governor Newsom's desk for a final decision. The outcome will determine whether California adopts a more industry-friendly approach to AI regulation or maintains stricter oversight in the face of emerging technological risks.&lt;/p&gt;

'What is going to be the position of a human scientist and an AI-Scientist in future scientific areas?' as well as 'What is going to be the proportiong of a research completed/accepted by an AI-Scientist by the scientific community?'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is Sakana AI?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sakana AI Scientist is an advanced AI system designed to autonomously carry out scientific research. Unlike other AI tools that assist in specific tasks, the Sakana AI Scientist can independently generate hypotheses, design and conduct experiments, and interpret the outcomes. This level of autonomy allows for a more efficient and scalable approach to scientific inquiry, potentially accelerating the pace of discovery across various fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Key Features of the Sakana AI Scientist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Autonomous Hypothesis Generation&lt;/strong&gt;: The Sakana AI Scientist is capable of formulating its own research questions based on the data it analyzes. This feature allows the AI to explore new research directions without needing explicit instructions from human scientists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Experiment Design and Execution&lt;/strong&gt;: Once a hypothesis is generated, the AI Scientist can design and execute experiments to test its theories. This involves selecting appropriate methodologies, gathering data, and conducting analyses—all autonomously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Data Interpretation and Insight Generation&lt;/strong&gt;: After conducting experiments, the AI Scientist interprets the results and generates insights, which can then be used to refine its hypotheses or shared with human researchers for further exploration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Adaptive Learning&lt;/strong&gt;: The AI Scientist continually learns from its experiences, improving its research methodologies and decision-making processes over time. This adaptive learning capability enables the AI to become more efficient and effective in its research efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Cross-Disciplinary Applications&lt;/strong&gt;: The Sakana AI Scientist is versatile and can be applied to various scientific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, physics, and materials science. This adaptability makes it a powerful tool for advancing knowledge across multiple fields simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Potential Impact of the Sakana AI Scientist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the Sakana AI Scientist has far-reaching implications for the scientific community and beyond:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Accelerated Scientific Discovery&lt;/strong&gt;: By automating the research process, the AI Scientist can conduct experiments at a much faster pace than human researchers, leading to quicker discoveries and advancements in various fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Scalable Research&lt;/strong&gt;: The AI’s ability to work independently and continuously means that large-scale research projects can be carried out more efficiently, potentially unlocking new knowledge that was previously inaccessible due to resource constraints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Democratization of Research&lt;/strong&gt;: The Sakana AI Scientist could make high-quality research more accessible to smaller institutions or organizations that lack the resources to conduct extensive studies. This could lead to a more equitable distribution of scientific knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Reduction in Human Error&lt;/strong&gt;: By relying on AI to conduct experiments and analyze data, the risk of human error is reduced, leading to more accurate and reliable results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Ethical and Normative Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;: As with any significant technological advancement, the rise of autonomous AI in scientific research raises ethical concerns, particularly around the transparency of AI-driven research processes, accountability for results, and the potential biases embedded in the AI’s algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ethical Considerations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated earlier, there are several issues that we need to consider, in order to agree and fully deploy AI-Scientist in our workload. The autonomy of the Sakana AI Scientist presents several ethical questions that the scientific community must address. These include concerns about the transparency of AI-driven research, the ownership of discoveries made by AI, the potential for AI to inadvertently introduce biases or errors into research, and of course the build-up of research community. Ensuring that the use of AI in science adheres to rigorous ethical standards will be crucial as this technology becomes more widespread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sakana AI Scientist represents a transformative step in the evolution of scientific research, offering a new model for how research can be conducted in the future. With its ability to autonomously generate hypotheses, design experiments, and interpret data, the AI Scientist has the potential to significantly accelerate the pace of discovery and democratize access to high-quality research. As the scientific community continues to integrate AI into its practices, the Sakana AI Scientist will undoubtedly play a central role in shaping the future of innovation and discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Extraction and interpretation of intricate information from unstructured text data arising in financial applications, such as earnings call transcripts, present substantial challenges to large language models (LLMs) even using the current best practices to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (referred to as VectorRAG techniques which utilize vector databases for information retrieval) due to challenges such as domain specific terminology and complex formats of the documents. We introduce a novel approach based on a combination, called HybridRAG, of the Knowledge Graphs (KGs) based RAG techniques (called GraphRAG) and VectorRAG techniques to enhance question-answer (Q&amp;amp;A) systems for information extraction from financial documents that is shown to be capable of generating accurate and contextually relevant answers. Using experiments on a set of financial earning call transcripts documents which come in the form of Q&amp;amp;A format, and hence provide a natural set of pairs of ground-truth Q&amp;amp;As, we show that HybridRAG which retrieves context from both vector database and KG outperforms both traditional VectorRAG and GraphRAG individually when evaluated at both the retrieval and generation stages in terms of retrieval accuracy and answer generation. The proposed technique has applications beyond the financial domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Enabling LLMs to improve their outputs by using more test-time computation is a critical step towards building generally self-improving agents that can operate on open-ended natural language. In this paper, we study the scaling of inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt? Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff inference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time inference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for a number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model's distribution over a response adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases, the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation motivates applying a &quot;compute-optimal&quot; scaling strategy, which acts to most effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute scaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to outperform a 14x larger model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Transformers have revolutionized machine learning, yet their inner workings remain opaque to many. We present Transformer Explainer, an interactive visualization tool designed for non-experts to learn about Transformers through the GPT-2 model. Our tool helps users understand complex Transformer concepts by integrating a model overview and enabling smooth transitions across abstraction levels of mathematical operations and model structures. It runs a live GPT-2 instance locally in the user's browser, empowering users to experiment with their own input and observe in real-time how the internal components and parameters of the Transformer work together to predict the next tokens. Our tool requires no installation or special hardware, broadening the public's education access to modern generative AI techniques. Our open-sourced tool is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/&quot;&gt;this https URL&lt;/a&gt;. A video demo is available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/ECR4oAwocjs&quot;&gt;this https URL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
