&lt;p&gt; Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned on a downstream task for a specific application. The most successful and most commonly used fine-tuning method is to update the pre-trained weights via a low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoRA introduces new weight matrices that are usually initialized at random with a uniform rank distribution across model weights. Recent works focus on weight-driven initialization or learning of adaptive ranks during training. Both approaches have only been investigated in isolation, resulting in slow convergence or a uniform rank distribution, in turn leading to sub-optimal performance. We propose to enhance LoRA by initializing the new weights in a data-driven manner by computing singular value decomposition on minibatches of activation vectors. Then, we initialize the LoRA matrices with the obtained right-singular vectors and re-distribute ranks among all weight matrices to explain the maximal amount of variance and continue the standard LoRA fine-tuning procedure. This results in our new method Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA). We apply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks ranging from language generation and understanding to image classification and reinforcement learning. EVA exhibits faster convergence than competitors and attains the highest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We introduce MLE-bench, a benchmark for measuring how well AI agents perform at machine learning engineering. To this end, we curate 75 ML engineering-related competitions from Kaggle, creating a diverse set of challenging tasks that test real-world ML engineering skills such as training models, preparing datasets, and running experiments. We establish human baselines for each competition using Kaggle's publicly available leaderboards. We use open-source agent scaffolds to evaluate several frontier language models on our benchmark, finding that the best-performing setup--OpenAI's o1-preview with AIDE scaffolding--achieves at least the level of a Kaggle bronze medal in 16.9% of competitions. In addition to our main results, we investigate various forms of resource scaling for AI agents and the impact of contamination from pre-training. We open-source our benchmark code (this http URL) to facilitate future research in understanding the ML engineering capabilities of AI agents.&lt;/p&gt;

By automating treatment planning and documentation, Neuromnia aims to improve clinician productivity and access to care while addressing workforce shortages in the ABA industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As autism affects one in 36 children, the demand for effective care solutions is higher than ever. Neuromnia is stepping up to meet this challenge by providing clinicians, parents, and teachers with advanced AI tools designed to enhance productivity and improve treatment quality. Their latest development, Nia, is a human-centric AI co-pilot built on &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/&quot;&gt;Llama 3.1&lt;/a&gt;, specifically tailored for Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuromnia's journey with Llama 3.1 began in May 2024 during the research and testing phase of product development. The team quickly recognized that the 70B model offered the natural language processing capabilities necessary to support their mission. Initially, they utilized Llama to generate behavior intervention plans and skill acquisition recommendations based on client case histories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Co-Founder &amp;amp; Chief Product Officer Josh Farrow, a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA), played a crucial role in curating a dataset that would help reduce the administrative burden on clinicians. According to Co-Founder &amp;amp; CEO Jay Gupta, “After testing with Llama, we were impressed by its state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing tasks.” This collaboration between clinical expertise and advanced AI technology has enabled Neuromnia to build a comprehensive dataset aimed at improving care delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source has been instrumental for startups like Neuromnia in developing scalable solutions without incurring prohibitive costs. The availability of open-source large language models (LLMs) like Llama 3.1 allows teams to leverage community advancements and contributions, refining their capabilities to meet the specific needs of the ABA industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gupta emphasizes that open source empowers them to build and scale their solutions without falling into vendor lock-in traps. The support from the community has proven invaluable for guidance on LLM creation and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nia is specifically designed to tackle workforce shortages in the ABA field by automating critical elements of treatment planning, documentation, and modification. By suggesting key treatment components—such as goals and intervention strategies—Nia reduces the time clinicians spend on repetitive tasks, allowing them to manage larger caseloads more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The platform also aims to address high burnout and turnover rates among ABA professionals by enhancing productivity through AI-powered capabilities. Gupta notes that many clinics lack robust analytics tools; however, Neuromnia provides automated insights that optimize the entire treatment process from intake to discharge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the release of Llama 3.1, Neuromnia has taken Nia’s capabilities to new heights. After resolving initial misconfigurations through trial and error, the team successfully integrated Llama into their platform. Techniques such as prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have been employed to enhance model output quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team has trained the LLM on clinician-created synthetic data to ensure accurate and context-appropriate recommendations within Nia’s software. Gupta explains that while out-of-the-box LLMs can struggle with complex tasks, they have significantly reduced error rates through a combination of fine-tuning and advanced techniques like semantic search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Neuromnia remains committed to leveraging Llama for ongoing improvements in autism care solutions. They are dedicated to evaluating each new release of Llama to ensure their platform stays cutting-edge and capable of meeting growing demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch of Neuromnia’s platform represents a significant step forward in autism care by combining advanced AI technology with clinical expertise. By automating key processes within ABA therapy, Neuromnia not only enhances clinician productivity but also improves access to quality care for families affected by autism.

&lt;p&gt; We introduce Pixtral-12B, a 12--billion-parameter multimodal language model. Pixtral-12B is trained to understand both natural images and documents, achieving leading performance on various multimodal benchmarks, surpassing a number of larger models. Unlike many open-source models, Pixtral is also a cutting-edge text model for its size, and does not compromise on natural language performance to excel in multimodal tasks. Pixtral uses a new vision encoder trained from scratch, which allows it to ingest images at their natural resolution and aspect ratio. This gives users flexibility on the number of tokens used to process an image. Pixtral is also able to process any number of images in its long context window of 128K tokens. Pixtral 12B substanially outperforms other open models of similar sizes (Llama-3.2 11B \&amp;amp; Qwen-2-VL 7B). It also outperforms much larger open models like Llama-3.2 90B while being 7x smaller. We further contribute an open-source benchmark, MM-MT-Bench, for evaluating vision-language models in practical scenarios, and provide detailed analysis and code for standardized evaluation protocols for multimodal LLMs. Pixtral-12B is released under Apache 2.0 license. &lt;/p&gt;

This feature enhances user interactions by allowing agents to learn from feedback and adapt to user preferences, ultimately improving the overall experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of long-term memory support in LangGraph marks a significant advancement in the capabilities of AI agents. Traditionally, many AI applications have struggled with maintaining context between conversations, often likened to a &quot;goldfish&quot; that forgets everything after each interaction. This limitation not only hampers efficiency but also restricts the potential of AI applications to provide personalized experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, LangChain has collaborated with various customers to integrate memory into their AI agents. Through these interactions, it became clear that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for AI memory. Different applications require specific logic tailored to their unique needs, which is why LangGraph's approach focuses on building a simple yet reliable persistent memory layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Key Features of Long-Term Memory Support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Thread Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; Extends memory capabilities across multiple conversation threads, allowing agents to remember information from previous interactions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent Document Store:&lt;/strong&gt; Utilizes a straightforward document storage system that supports basic operations like putting, getting, and searching for saved memories.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Namespacing:&lt;/strong&gt; Organizes memories using custom namespaces for better management across different users or contexts.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JSON Document Storage:&lt;/strong&gt; Saves memories as JSON documents, facilitating easy manipulation and retrieval.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content-Based Filtering:&lt;/strong&gt; Enables searching through memories based on their content across namespaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assist developers in implementing long-term memory within their applications, LangChain has provided several resources. A new LangGraph template is available that showcases a chatbot agent capable of managing its own memory. This template serves as a practical demonstration of how to leverage long-term memory features effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Transformer tends to overallocate attention to irrelevant context. In this work, we introduce Diff Transformer, which amplifies attention to the relevant context while canceling noise. Specifically, the differential attention mechanism calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps. The subtraction cancels noise, promoting the emergence of sparse attention patterns. Experimental results on language modeling show that Diff Transformer outperforms Transformer in various settings of scaling up model size and training tokens. More intriguingly, it offers notable advantages in practical applications, such as long-context modeling, key information retrieval, hallucination mitigation, in-context learning, and reduction of activation outliers. By being less distracted by irrelevant context, Diff Transformer can mitigate hallucination in question answering and text summarization. For in-context learning, Diff Transformer not only enhances accuracy but is also more robust to order permutation, which was considered as a chronic robustness issue. The results position Diff Transformer as a highly effective and promising architecture to advance large language models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Dense document embeddings are central to neural retrieval. The dominant paradigm is to train and construct embeddings by running encoders directly on individual documents. In this work, we argue that these embeddings, while effective, are implicitly out-of-context for targeted use cases of retrieval, and that a contextualized document embedding should take into account both the document and neighboring documents in context - analogous to contextualized word embeddings. We propose two complementary methods for contextualized document embeddings: first, an alternative contrastive learning objective that explicitly incorporates the document neighbors into the intra-batch contextual loss; second, a new contextual architecture that explicitly encodes neighbor document information into the encoded representation. Results show that both methods achieve better performance than biencoders in several settings, with differences especially pronounced out-of-domain. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the MTEB benchmark with no hard negative mining, score distillation, dataset-specific instructions, intra-GPU example-sharing, or extremely large batch sizes. Our method can be applied to improve performance on any contrastive learning dataset and any biencoder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movie Gen is part of Meta's ongoing commitment to sharing foundational AI research with the community. This journey began with the Make-A-Scene series, which enabled the creation of images, audio, video, and 3D animations. Following this, the Llama Image foundation models improved the quality of image and video generation. Now, Movie Gen combines these advancements into a comprehensive suite that allows for unprecedented control over creative outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Movie Gen boasts four primary capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Generation:&lt;/strong&gt; Generates high-definition videos from text prompts.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized Video Generation:&lt;/strong&gt; Creates customized videos featuring specific individuals based on their images and text prompts.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precise Video Editing:&lt;/strong&gt; Allows for detailed edits on existing videos using both video and text inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audio Generation:&lt;/strong&gt; Produces high-quality audio that syncs with generated or edited videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video generation feature utilizes a 30B parameter transformer model capable of producing videos up to 16 seconds long at a rate of 16 frames per second. This model excels at reasoning about object motion and interactions within the scene, making it a state-of-the-art solution for generating dynamic video content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature takes personalization a step further by combining a person's image with relevant text prompts to create unique videos that maintain the individual's identity and motion. The results have been recognized as state-of-the-art in preserving human likeness while generating engaging content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The editing variant of Movie Gen allows users to make localized edits—like adding or removing elements—while preserving the original content. This capability combines advanced image editing techniques with video generation, enabling users to achieve desired outcomes without requiring specialized skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The audio generation model can produce high-fidelity audio that complements video content. It supports various audio elements such as ambient sounds and instrumental music, achieving state-of-the-art performance in aligning audio with both video and text prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of these models involved numerous technical innovations in architecture and training methodologies. A/B human evaluations show that users prefer Movie Gen’s outputs over competing models across all four capabilities. While these results are promising, Meta acknowledges that further optimizations are necessary to enhance inference speed and overall quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, Meta aims to collaborate closely with filmmakers and creators to refine Movie Gen based on user feedback. The goal is to create tools that not only enhance creativity but also open new avenues for self-expression. Future applications could include personalized animated greetings or dynamic storytelling videos shared across social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inline Suggestions:&lt;/strong&gt; ChatGPT offers real-time suggestions and feedback on highlighted sections.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Version Control:&lt;/strong&gt; Users can restore previous versions of their work easily using a back button.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing Shortcuts:&lt;/strong&gt; A variety of shortcuts enable quick adjustments such as changing document length or reading level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding is inherently iterative, and Canvas simplifies this process by allowing users to track changes more effectively. The model provides various coding shortcuts that enhance the development experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Coding Shortcuts Include:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Code:&lt;/strong&gt; Inline suggestions help improve code quality.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Logs:&lt;/strong&gt; Print statements can be inserted to assist with debugging.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Comments:&lt;/strong&gt; Comments can be added for clarity within the code.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix Bugs:&lt;/strong&gt; The model can detect and rewrite problematic code snippets.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Port to Other Languages:&lt;/strong&gt; Code can be translated into various programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying GPT-4o model has been trained specifically for collaboration, allowing it to understand when to open a Canvas and how to make targeted edits. OpenAI's research team has focused on developing core behaviors that enhance this collaborative experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Core Behaviors Include:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Triggering Canvas:&lt;/strong&gt; The model intelligently decides when to open a Canvas based on user prompts.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diverse Content Generation:&lt;/strong&gt; It can generate various types of content effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit and Rewrite:&lt;/strong&gt; The model makes targeted edits or rewrites based on user selections.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inline Critique:&lt;/strong&gt; Provides constructive feedback on user-generated content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of Canvas marks a significant evolution in how users interact with AI tools. OpenAI plans to rapidly improve its capabilities based on user feedback during this early beta phase, aiming to enhance both functionality and user experience further.&lt;/p&gt;
