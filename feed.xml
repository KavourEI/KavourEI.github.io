&lt;p&gt; In-context learning (ICL) adapts LLMs by providing demonstrations without fine-tuning the model parameters; however, it does not differentiate between demonstrations and quadratically increases the complexity of Transformer LLMs, exhausting the memory. As a solution, we propose Mixtures of In-Context Learners (MoICL), a novel approach to treat subsets of demonstrations as experts and learn a weighting function to merge their output distributions based on a training set. In our experiments, we show performance improvements on 5 out of 7 classification datasets compared to a set of strong baselines (up to +13\% compared to ICL and LENS). Moreover, we enhance the Pareto frontier of ICL by reducing the inference time needed to achieve the same performance with fewer demonstrations. Finally, MoICL is more robust to out-of-domain (up to +11\%), imbalanced (up to +49\%), or noisy demonstrations (up to +38\%) or can filter these out from datasets. Overall, MoICL is a more expressive approach to learning from demonstrations without exhausting the context window or memory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Models that rely on subword tokenization have significant drawbacks, such as sensitivity to character-level noise like spelling errors and inconsistent compression rates across different languages and scripts. While character- or byte-level models like ByT5 attempt to address these concerns, they have not gained widespread adoption -- processing raw byte streams without tokenization results in significantly longer sequence lengths, making training and inference inefficient. This work introduces MrT5 (MergeT5), a more efficient variant of ByT5 that integrates a token deletion mechanism in its encoder to dynamically shorten the input sequence length. After processing through a fixed number of encoder layers, a learnt delete gate determines which tokens are to be removed and which are to be retained for subsequent layers. MrT5 effectively ``merges'' critical information from deleted tokens into a more compact sequence, leveraging contextual information from the remaining tokens. In continued pre-training experiments, we find that MrT5 can achieve significant gains in inference runtime with minimal effect on performance. When trained on English text, MrT5 demonstrates the capability to transfer its deletion feature zero-shot across several languages, with significant additional improvements following multilingual training. Furthermore, MrT5 shows comparable accuracy to ByT5 on downstream evaluations such as XNLI and character-level tasks while reducing sequence lengths by up to 80%. Our approach presents a solution to the practical limitations of existing byte-level models. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of these state-of-the-art models involved innovative quantization techniques:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta employed Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) to simulate quantization effects during model training. This approach optimizes performance in low-precision environments by fine-tuning model checkpoints obtained after supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The process includes applying low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to QAT, Meta introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16406&quot;&gt;SpinQuant&lt;/a&gt;, a technique for post-training quantization that allows developers to quantize their fine-tuned models without requiring access to training datasets. SpinQuant is particularly beneficial for scenarios where data availability is limited, offering a portable solution for various hardware targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Performance Evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance metrics for the quantized models reveal impressive results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decode Latency Improvement:&lt;/strong&gt; Enhanced by an average of 2.5 times.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prefill Latency Improvement:&lt;/strong&gt; Increased by an average of 4.2 times.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Usage Reduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Decreased by an average of 41%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of Llama 3.2 was made possible through close collaboration with industry partners such as Qualcomm and MediaTek. Looking ahead, Meta aims to further enhance performance by leveraging Neural Processing Units (NPUs) alongside Arm CPUs, thus expanding the capabilities of the Llama models in mobile environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of Llama 3.2 marks a significant step forward in making advanced AI accessible for mobile devices. With its focus on lightweight deployment and community collaboration, Meta continues to lead in innovation while fostering an ecosystem that encourages responsible AI use.&lt;/p&gt;
