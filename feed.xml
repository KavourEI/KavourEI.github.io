Our top model rivals proprietary systems across both academic benchmarks and human evaluations, while our smaller models outperform competitors up to 10 times their size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;576&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/spBxYa3eAlA&quot; title=&quot;👋 Meet Molmo: A Family of Open State-of-the-Art Multimodal AI Models&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Although current multimodal models can interpret diverse data and express it in natural language, Molmo goes further. By learning to point at objects it perceives, Molmo facilitates richer interactions with the physical and virtual world, unlocking the potential for next-gen applications that can both act and interact within their environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; Open, Cutting-Edge, and Actionable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Most advanced multimodal models today are proprietary, and efforts to create open models have lagged behind. Often, the best-performing open models rely heavily on synthetic data derived from proprietary systems. Consequently, the AI community lacks critical foundational knowledge to develop high-performing vision-language models (VLMs) from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Molmo fills this gap. Our VLM pipeline—spanning weights, code, data, and evaluations—is entirely open, starting with a pre-trained vision encoder (CLIP) and language-only LLMs, free from reliance on proprietary models. A core innovation is our highly detailed image caption dataset, built entirely from speech-based human descriptions, and a diverse fine-tuning dataset that includes 2D pointing data, enabling Molmo to respond not only with language but also with gestures. This opens up new opportunities for VLMs to interact with both virtual and physical worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The best model in the Molmo family outshines other open models and compares favorably with leading proprietary systems like GPT-4V, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.5. Starting today, we are releasing select model weights, inference code, and a public demo of Molmo-7B-D, with full model weights and data coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; PixMo: Quality Over Quantity in Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; While many VLMs are trained on billions of noisy web-sourced image-text pairs, leading to hallucinations in model output, Molmo takes a different path by emphasizing data quality over quantity. Our models are trained on fewer than 1 million high-quality image-text pairs, allowing them to perform better with significantly less data.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The cornerstone of Molmo's success is its training data, PixMo, which consists of two main types: (1) dense captioning data for multimodal pre-training and (2) supervised fine-tuning data for tasks like question answering, document reading, and pointing. Unlike other approaches that distill existing VLMs, we focus on building from scratch, collecting dense captions from human annotators using speech, a method that yields richer and more detailed descriptions than written annotations. This process generated detailed audio descriptions for 712,000 images across 50 key topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Our fine-tuning data includes both academic datasets and newly collected data, designed to enhance capabilities like answering open-ended questions, improving OCR tasks, and pointing to specific elements in images. This pointing ability is crucial for future interactions between VLMs and agents, such as robots identifying objects or web agents locating UI elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; Benchmarking and Human Evaluations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Vision-language model evaluation is evolving, and academic benchmarks only provide part of the picture. To complement these, we also conduct large-scale human preference evaluations. Our results draw from 325,231 pairwise comparisons across 27 models, the largest human preference study for multimodal models to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Our findings show that Molmo performs competitively across both academic benchmarks and human evaluations. In particular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; MolmoE-1B, a highly efficient model, nearly matches GPT-4V on both benchmarks and user preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Molmo-7B comfortably sits between GPT-4V and GPT-4o, outperforming Pixtral 12B.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Our top model, Molmo-72B, achieves the highest academic scores and ranks second in human evaluations, just behind GPT-4o.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; Model Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Molmo’s architecture follows a simple yet powerful framework: a pre-trained vision encoder combined with a language model. It consists of four parts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Pre-processor: Converts input images into multiscale, multi-crop versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; ViT Image Encoder: Maps the images into vision tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Connector: Projects vision tokens into the language model’s input dimension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Decoder-only Transformer LLM: Generates the final output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Our models use OpenAI's ViT-L/14 CLIP model as the vision encoder and various LLMs at different scales, such as OLMo-7B-1024 and OLMoE-1B-7B-0924, depending on the model size. The training process involves two stages: multimodal pre-training for caption generation and supervised fine-tuning, with all parameters updated throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By innovating in both data collection and model architecture, Molmo pushes the boundaries of what open AI models can achieve, offering a robust, high-performing alternative to proprietary systems.

The open-source model promises a more flexible and scalable approach, providing advanced solutions for short-term weather forecasting and long-term climate projections, available for download on Hugging Face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;IBM and NASA Launch a New AI Model for Weather and Climate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a significant step for meteorology and climate science, IBM and NASA have collaborated to develop a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence&quot;&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; foundation model tailored for a wide range of weather and climate use cases. With contributions from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, this model, dubbed &amp;lt;a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13598'&amp;gt;Prithvi WxC&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, stands out for its versatility and scalability, offering an advanced tool for tackling weather forecasts and climate predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional models, Prithvi WxC can be fine-tuned to suit different scales—global, regional, or local—making it adaptable for various scientific and industry applications. Whether it’s creating localized weather forecasts or refining long-term climate simulations, this AI model represents a leap forward in environmental analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Groundbreaking Applications: From Severe Weather to Climate Projections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather and climate foundation model offers more than just incremental improvements—it opens new possibilities for tackling complex environmental problems. The model's flexible architecture enables it to be used for multiple applications, including creating targeted forecasts from local data and improving the resolution of global climate simulations. In one notable experiment, the model reconstructed global surface temperatures using only 5% of the original data, highlighting its potential for data assimilation and forecasting in data-sparse environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two specialized fine-tuned versions of the model are available for specific use cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Climate and Weather Data Downscaling: This version enhances spatial resolution by up to 12x, making it ideal for generating high-resolution climate projections from low-resolution inputs such as temperature, precipitation, and wind data. This version is now available on the IBM Granite Hugging Face page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Gravity Wave Parameterization: Gravity waves, which influence atmospheric processes like cloud formation and turbulence, have long posed challenges for accurate modeling. The AI model’s ability to better estimate these waves could significantly improve numerical weather and climate models. This fine-tuned version is part of the NASA-IBM Prithvi models on Hugging Face.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Collaborative Innovation and the Path Forward: The model builds on years of collaboration between IBM, NASA, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, with each partner contributing their expertise to enhance AI's role in climate science. Pre-trained on 40 years of Earth observation data from NASA’s MERRA-2 dataset, the model's ability to operate on various scales makes it unique in the field.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to IBM’s Juan Bernabe-Moreno, the model’s flexibility sets it apart from other large AI models, which often focus on specific datasets or singular applications like forecasting. The new weather and climate foundation model, however, is designed to accommodate multiple inputs and outputs, allowing it to run on both global and local contexts. This opens new doors for studying phenomena like hurricanes, atmospheric rivers, and long-term climate risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Open Access and Future Impact&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the model open-source on Hugging Face is a pivotal step (you can access it through the &amp;lt;a href=https://huggingface.co/Prithvi-WxC'&amp;gt;NASA-IBM Hugging Face&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; page and the downscaling mode can be accessed thgouth the &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite&quot;&gt;IBM Granite Hugging Face&lt;/a&gt; page ), democratizing access to cutting-edge climate AI tools. Two versions—the downscaling and gravity wave parameterization models—are now accessible to researchers, developers, and businesses alike. This move follows IBM and NASA’s prior success with the Prithvi geospatial foundation model, which has been used to study disaster patterns, biodiversity, and land-use changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already, IBM is collaborating with Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) to test the model’s capacity for short-term precipitation forecasting and other advanced use cases. This type of real-time application shows the model’s potential to transform not just climate research but also the way industries, governments, and communities respond to weather events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;IBM’s Broader Vision for AI and Climate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM's long-standing commitment to AI and climate solutions is evident in its continued partnerships and innovations. This model is part of a broader effort to use AI to address some of the world’s most pressing environmental challenges. As Arjun Shankar of Oak Ridge National Laboratory notes, this collaboration is key to supporting breakthroughs in computational science, a critical component in improving the accuracy of climate models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With rapid climate change altering weather patterns globally, models like Prithvi WxC are poised to play an increasingly vital role in both understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change. By making advanced AI tools available to the scientific and business communities, IBM and NASA are empowering more stakeholders to engage with climate science and make informed decisions in the face of future risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, IBM and NASA's release of the Prithvi WxC weather and climate foundation model marks a major milestone in the integration of AI with environmental science. Its open-source availability promises to accelerate innovation across industries and research fields, making advanced weather forecasting and climate modeling more accessible than ever before. With this new tool in the hands of developers and scientists, the future of climate research is looking smarter, faster, and more scalable.
