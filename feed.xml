&lt;p&gt; Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of data to generate natural language, enabling them to perform tasks like text summarization and question answering. These models have become popular in artificial intelligence (AI) assistants like ChatGPT and already play an influential role in how humans access information. However, the behavior of LLMs varies depending on their design, training, and use.
In this paper, we uncover notable diversity in the ideological stance exhibited across different LLMs and languages in which they are accessed. We do this by prompting a diverse panel of popular LLMs to describe a large number of prominent and controversial personalities from recent world history, both in English and in Chinese. By identifying and analyzing moral assessments reflected in the generated descriptions, we find consistent normative differences between how the same LLM responds in Chinese compared to English. Similarly, we identify normative disagreements between Western and non-Western LLMs about prominent actors in geopolitical conflicts. Furthermore, popularly hypothesized disparities in political goals among Western models are reflected in significant normative differences related to inclusion, social inequality, and political scandals.
Our results show that the ideological stance of an LLM often reflects the worldview of its creators. This raises important concerns around technological and regulatory efforts with the stated aim of making LLMs ideologically `unbiased', and it poses risks for political instrumentalization. &lt;/p&gt;

Open-sourced for broader accessibility, SynthID aims to enhance transparency and trust in AI-generated materials across various platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As artificial intelligence continues to permeate various aspects of our lives, the challenge of distinguishing between human-generated and AI-generated content has become increasingly pressing. The rise of misinformation, plagiarism, and copyright issues necessitates robust tools to verify content authenticity. In response to these challenges, Google DeepMind has launched SynthID, a watermarking technology that aims to identify AI-generated text effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SynthID is a watermarking tool developed by Google DeepMind in collaboration with Hugging Face. Initially launched for images and videos, it has now been expanded to include AI-generated text. This tool embeds an imperceptible digital watermark directly into the text generated by specific language models (LLMs), allowing for easy identification without compromising the quality or fluency of the output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core functionality of SynthID lies in its ability to adjust the probability scores of tokens—units of text such as characters or words—during the generation process. By subtly modifying these scores, SynthID embeds a unique watermark within the text. This adjustment is executed in a way that does not alter the overall quality or coherence of the generated content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large language models generate text by predicting the next token based on preceding words. Each potential token is assigned a probability score reflecting its likelihood of being chosen. SynthID modifies these scores for specific tokens to create a distinctive pattern that serves as a watermark. This technique ensures that even as the model generates coherent sentences, the embedded watermark remains intact and detectable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Google DeepMind announced that SynthID would be available as open-source software through its &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google.dev/responsible/docs/safeguards/synthid&quot;&gt;Responsible Generative AI Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;. This decision aims to broaden the technology's compatibility with various tools and platforms, allowing other developers to integrate it into their own models. This initiative will enable more developers to build AI responsibly by providing them with essential tools for identifying AI-generated content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant aspect of SynthID's development involved extensive testing to ensure that the watermarking process did not degrade the quality of AI-generated text. In a study analyzing approximately 20 million chatbot responses, researchers found no noticeable difference in quality or usefulness between watermarked and unwatermarked outputs. However, limitations exist; for instance, SynthID's effectiveness diminishes when dealing with factual prompts or when generated text undergoes significant rewriting or translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving reliable watermarking for AI-generated text presents unique challenges. The technique works best with longer responses where there are multiple opportunities to adjust token probabilities without compromising factual accuracy or coherence. However, in scenarios where outputs are deterministic—like answering straightforward factual questions—the watermarking may not be as effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has demonstrated strong performance in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While theoretical investigations have been conducted to understand CoT, the underlying transformer used in these studies isolates the CoT reasoning process into separated in-context learning steps (Stepwise ICL). In this work, we theoretically show that, compared to Stepwise ICL, the transformer gains better error correction ability and more accurate predictions if the reasoning from earlier steps (Coherent CoT) is integrated. Given that this coherent reasoning changes the behavior of the transformer, we further investigate the sensitivity of the transformer with Coherent CoT when the demonstration examples are corrupted at the inference stage. Our theoretical results indicate that the transformer is more sensitive to errors in intermediate reasoning steps than the final outcome. Building upon this observation, we propose an improvement on CoT by incorporating both correct and incorrect reasoning paths in the demonstration. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. &lt;/p&gt;
