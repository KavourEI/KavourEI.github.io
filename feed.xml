This model is a pruned and distilled version of the Mistral NeMo 12B, maintaining high performance while being significantly more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; Pruning and Distillation: Key Techniques&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Mistral-NeMo-Minitron 8B model is created using NVIDIA’s proven approach of model pruning and knowledge distillation. Pruning reduces the model size by removing less critical parts—specifically, by focusing on width pruning, which targets neurons, attention heads, and embedding channels. This approach, when combined with light retraining through knowledge distillation, yields a smaller, faster, and more resource-efficient model without compromising much on predictive power.&lt;/p&gt;

Accuracy of the Mistral-NeMo-Minitron 8B base model compared to the teacher Mistral-NeMo 12B, Gemma 7B, and Llama-3.1 8B base models. Bold numbers represent the best among the 8B model class&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Model Pruning involves slimming down the model by either dropping layers (depth pruning) or reducing the size of internal components (width pruning). In this case, width pruning was employed, which reduced the MLP intermediate dimensions and hidden sizes while retaining the number of attention heads and layers. This method is preferred as it consistently outperforms depth pruning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Knowledge Distillation serves to transfer knowledge from a larger &quot;teacher&quot; model (in this case, the Mistral NeMo 12B) to the smaller &quot;student&quot; model (Mistral-NeMo-Minitron 8B). This step involves retraining the pruned model with a smaller dataset, ensuring it maintains high accuracy while being faster and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; Process and Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Teacher Fine-Tuning&lt;/strong&gt;: The unpruned 12B model was fine-tuned with 127 billion tokens to correct distribution shifts, ensuring optimal performance during distillation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Width Pruning&lt;/strong&gt;: Importance scores were calculated for pruning, focusing on compressing the MLP intermediate dimension and the hidden size, while maintaining the number of attention heads and layers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Distillation&lt;/strong&gt;: The pruned model was distilled using a carefully controlled training process, ensuring minimal loss of accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The result is a model that not only rivals but often surpasses similar-sized models in accuracy, while also being significantly more resource-efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; Conclusion and Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The Mistral-NeMo-Minitron 8B demonstrates the effectiveness of structured weight pruning combined with knowledge distillation, offering a scalable approach to building efficient and high-performing LLMs. NVIDIA plans to continue refining these techniques, with future efforts aimed at creating even smaller, more accurate models. These innovations will be gradually integrated into the NVIDIA NeMo framework, further advancing the field of generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This advancement highlights NVIDIA’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI model efficiency, making powerful AI more accessible and cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;

However, these models often struggle with accuracy, particularly when tasked with answering complex, knowledge-intensive questions. This challenge has given rise to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which combine LLMs with external knowledge retrieval to improve the factual accuracy of responses. While RAG enhances accuracy, it comes with trade-offs in efficiency, especially when dealing with large amounts of retrieved data that require complex reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address this, a novel framework called &lt;strong&gt;Speculative RAG&lt;/strong&gt; has been introduced. This approach optimizes the balance between accuracy and efficiency by leveraging a two-step process: drafting and verification. The process begins with a smaller, specialized LLM—referred to as the &lt;i&gt;RAG drafter&lt;/i&gt;—that generates multiple draft responses based on retrieved documents. These drafts are then fed into a larger, &lt;i&gt;generalist LLM&lt;/i&gt;—acting as the verifier—to select the most accurate and contextually appropriate response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculative RAG employs a technique known as speculative decoding, which speeds up the inference process by allowing the specialist LLM to generate multiple drafts simultaneously. This method not only reduces the computational load on the larger LLM but also ensures that the final output is both accurate and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, when asked a question like &quot;Which actress starred as Doralee Rhodes in the 1980 film Nine to Five?&quot;, the RAG system retrieves relevant documents from its knowledge base. The specialist drafter quickly generates several possible answers, each backed by its rationale. The generalist verifier then assesses these drafts, filtering out any inaccuracies—such as information mistakenly drawn from a related but incorrect source, like the Nine to Five musical—and selects the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of Speculative RAG is demonstrated through rigorous benchmarking against standard RAG systems across datasets such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://aclanthology.org/P17-1147/&quot;&gt;TriviaQA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00573&quot;&gt;MuSiQue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neemakot/Health-Fact-Checking&quot;&gt;PubHealth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://allenai.org/data/arc&quot;&gt;ARC-Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. Results show that Speculative RAG not only achieves higher accuracy—outperforming traditional methods by up to 12.97% on some datasets—but also significantly reduces latency, cutting response times by as much as 51%. This dual improvement in both speed and accuracy represents a significant leap forward in the performance of RAG systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-research2023-media/images/Speculative_RAG_img2.width-800.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of Speculative RAG underscores the potential of collaborative AI architectures, where tasks are intelligently divided between specialized and generalist models. By offloading specific tasks to models optimized for those functions, Speculative RAG provides a robust framework for enhancing the quality of AI-generated content while maintaining efficiency. As AI continues to evolve, such innovations will be crucial in developing systems that are not only powerful but also reliable and quick, paving the way for more sophisticated and responsive AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Planning remains one of the last standing bastions for large language models (LLMs), which now turn their attention to search. Most of the literature uses the language models as world models to define the search space, forgoing soundness for the sake of flexibility. A recent work, Thought of Search (ToS), proposed defining the search space with code, having the language models produce that code. ToS requires a human in the loop, collaboratively producing a sound successor func- tion and goal test. The result, however, is worth the effort: all the tested datasets were solved with 100% accuracy. At the same time LLMs have demonstrated significant progress in code generation and refinement for complex reasoning tasks.
In this work, we automate ToS (AutoToS), completely tak- ing the human out of the loop of solving planning problems. AutoToS guides the language model step by step towards the generation of sound and complete search components, through feedback from both generic and domain specific unit tests. We achieve 100% accuracy, with minimal feedback iter- ations, using LLMs of various sizes on all evaluated domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Including code in the pre-training data mixture, even for models not specifically designed for code, has become a common practice in LLMs pre-training. While there has been anecdotal consensus among practitioners that code data plays a vital role in general LLMs’ performance, there is only limited work analyzing the precise impact of code on non-code tasks. In this work, we system- atically investigate the impact of code data on general performance. We ask “what is the impact of code data used in pre-training on a large variety of downstream tasks beyond code generation”. We conduct extensive ablations and evaluate across a broad range of natural language reasoning tasks, world knowledge tasks, code benchmarks, and LLM-as-a-judge win-rates for models with sizes ranging from 470M to 2.8B parameters. Across settings, we find a consistent results that code is a critical building block for generalization far beyond coding tasks and improvements to code quality have an outsized impact across all tasks. In particular, compared to text-only pre-training, the ad- dition of code results in up to relative increase of 8.2% in natural language (NL) reasoning, 4.2% in world knowledge, 6.6% improvement in generative win-rates, and a 12x boost in code performance respectively. Our work suggests investments in code quality and preserving code during pre-training have positive impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We introduce Transfusion, a recipe for training a multi-modal model over discrete and continuous data. Transfusion combines the language modeling loss function (next token prediction) with diffusion to train a single transformer over mixed- modality sequences. We pretrain multiple Transfusion models up to 7B parameters from scratch on a mixture of text and image data, establishing scaling laws with respect to a variety of uni- and cross-modal benchmarks. Our experiments show that Transfusion scales significantly better than quantizing images and training a language model over discrete image tokens. By introducing modality-specific en- coding and decoding layers, we can further improve the performance of Transfusion models, and even compress each image to just 16 patches. We further demonstrate that scaling our Transfusion recipe to 7B parameters and 2T multi-modal tokens produces a model that can generate images and text on a par with similar scale diffusion models and language models, reaping the benefits of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In today's music streaming landscape, platforms like YouTube Music boast enormous catalogs, making personalized recommendations essential for user satisfaction. YouTube Music has over 100 million songs globally, and leveraging advanced algorithms is critical to cater to diverse user preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; YouTube Music has adopted &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.google/blog/transformer-a-novel-neural-network-architecture-for-language-understanding/&quot;&gt;Transformer&lt;/a&gt; models to refine its recommendation system, significantly enhancing the way users discover music. Traditional recommendation systems rely heavily on user actions—like, dislike, and skip—to understand preferences. However, these actions can be context-dependent. For instance, a user might skip uptempo songs when relaxing but enjoy them during a workout. Recognizing these nuances, YouTube Music's new approach integrates the Transformer architecture to better understand and predict user preferences based on context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; The Challenge of Contextual Music Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Music recommendations must balance a user's historical preferences with their current context. In older systems, recommendations might demote songs a user typically skips, even if those songs are relevant in a specific context, like exercising. This led to a gap in accurately predicting what a user might enjoy at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Transformer model offers a solution by analyzing the sequence of user actions and understanding which actions should be prioritized based on the current context. For example, the model might assign different weights to a skip action depending on whether the user is at the gym or relaxing at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; The Role of Transformers in YouTube Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Transformers, known for their success in natural language processing tasks like translation, are particularly suited to handle the sequential nature of user interactions with music. They excel at capturing relationships within a sequence of actions, such as listening history, and applying attention mechanisms to discern which actions are most relevant to current user needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In YouTube Music, the Transformer architecture works alongside existing ranking models. It takes into account various signals, such as the user's intention behind an action, the percentage of the song played, and other metadata like the artist or music language. These signals are encoded into vectors and combined with track embeddings, allowing the Transformer to accurately score and rank music items based on both historical and contextual user data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; Results and Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Implementing Transformers in YouTube Music's recommendation system has yielded promising results, including a reduction in skip rates and an increase in listening time, both of which indicate higher user satisfaction. This success opens up further opportunities to refine the system, such as incorporating the Transformer model into other parts of the recommendation process, like item retrieval, and exploring the integration of non-sequential features for even more precise recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As music streaming continues to evolve, the ability to understand and adapt to user behavior in real time will be key to delivering personalized and satisfying experiences. YouTube Music's adoption of Transformers marks a significant step forward in this journey, providing users with recommendations that are more aligned with their current context and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
