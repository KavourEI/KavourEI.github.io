<p> I hope you enjoy every step so far. Until thiw point of our Langchain/Rag journey, we have managed to build a simple local application and a querry transformation assistant. But what happens when we have multiple data sources? How to define where our application will retrieve the required information from? The definition of this process, finding the correct road, or better let's say finnding the correct route, is called Routing.</p>

<p> There are many ways to give directions in real life, this applies here as well! As we can see in the following image, there are two main categories of routing. 

<ul>
<li> <strong>Logical Routing</strong>: </li>
<li> <strong>Semantic Routing</strong>: </li>
</ul>
</p>
