      <link href="http://localhost:4000/Nexa" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Breakthrough in Multimodal AI for Edge Devices by Nexa.AI's OmniVision" />
      <published>2024-11-15T00:00:00+02:00</published>
      <updated>2024-11-15T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/Nexa</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Nexa">&lt;p&gt;Nexa AI's OmniVision is a compact multimodal model designed for processing both visual and text inputs, optimized for edge devices, showcasing significant advancements in art analysis, scene comprehension, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Nexa AI's OmniVision represents a significant leap in this domain, offering a sub-billion parameter multimodal model that effectively processes visual and textual inputs. With its recent upgrade to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/NexaAIDev/omnivision-968M&quot;&gt;OmniVision-968M&lt;/a&gt; version, the model has improved capabilities in art analysis, scene comprehension, style recognition, color perception, and world knowledge. This article delves into the architecture, training methodology, and performance benchmarks of OmniVision, highlighting its potential applications in edge computing environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OmniVision is designed to operate efficiently on edge devices, making it suitable for various applications where computational resources are limited. The model operates with an FP16 version requiring only 988 MB of RAM and 948 MB of storage space. Its architecture consists of three key components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vision Encoder:&lt;/strong&gt; This component transforms input images into embeddings that can be processed further.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Projection Layer:&lt;/strong&gt; It aligns the image embeddings with the token space of the Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct model, enabling effective visual-language understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response Generation:&lt;/strong&gt; The model generates responses based on both visual and textual inputs, enhancing its contextual understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of OmniVision involved a three-stage training pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage One:&lt;/strong&gt; Establishing basic visual-linguistic alignments using image-caption pairs while only unfreezing the projection layer parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Two:&lt;/strong&gt; Enhancing contextual understanding through image-based question-answering datasets, allowing the model to generate contextually appropriate responses.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Three:&lt;/strong&gt; Implementing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by generating responses to images and refining them through a teacher model that produces minimally edited corrections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable challenge in deploying multimodal models on edge devices is the computational overhead associated with processing image tokens. Traditional architectures like LLaVA generate numerous tokens per image, leading to high latency and costs. To address this, OmniVision employs a reshaping mechanism during the projection stage that compresses image embeddings from `[batch_size, 729, hidden_size]` to `[batch_size, 81, hidden_size*9]`. This reduction in token count improves performance significantly while maintaining output quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DPO approach used in OmniVision focuses on generating minimal-edit pairs for training. By ensuring that the teacher model makes small adjustments to the base model's outputs while preserving their structure, this technique enhances output quality without disrupting core capabilities. This method allows for precise improvements in accuracy-critical elements of the model's responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The performance of OmniVision has been evaluated against various benchmark datasets including MM-VET, ChartQA, MMMU, ScienceQA, and POPE. The results demonstrate that OmniVision consistently outperforms previous models such as nanoLLAVA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

        &lt;th&gt;Benchmark&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;OmniVision&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;NanoLLAVA&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Qwen2-VL-2B&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;MM-VET&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;27.5&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;23.9&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;49.5&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;ChartQA (Test)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;59.2&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;N/A&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;73.5&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;MMMU (Test)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;41.8&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;28.6&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;41.1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;ScienceQA (Eval)&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;62.2&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;59.0&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;N/A&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;POPE&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;89.4&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;84.1&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;N/A&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nexa AI is committed to further developing OmniVision into a fully optimized solution for edge AI multimodal applications. While the current version demonstrates impressive capabilities, ongoing improvements aim to address existing limitations and enhance overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title type="html">Revolutionizing Synthetic Data Generation with Orca-AgentInstruct</title>
      <link href="http://localhost:4000/OrcaAgentInstruct" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Revolutionizing Synthetic Data Generation with Orca-AgentInstruct" />
      <published>2024-11-14T00:00:00+02:00</published>
      <updated>2024-11-14T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/OrcaAgentInstruct</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/OrcaAgentInstruct">&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Orca-AgentInstruct presents a novel approach to synthetic data generation, leveraging agentic flows to create high-quality datasets that enhance the performance of language models, demonstrating significant improvements across various benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synthetic data generation emerging as a critical component for training and fine-tuning language models. Microsoft's recent work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/orca-progressive-learning-from-complex-explanation-traces-of-gpt-4/&quot;&gt;Orca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/&quot;&gt;Orca 2&lt;/a&gt; has showcased the potential of using synthetic data to elevate the performance of smaller models to levels previously achieved only by larger counterparts. The introduction of Orca-AgentInstruct marks another significant advancement in this domain, utilizing agentic flows to generate diverse and high-quality data at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synthetic data has proven instrumental in accelerating the development of large language models (LLMs). By creating tailored datasets from raw data sources, Orca-AgentInstruct allows for efficient model fine-tuning and enhances overall performance. For instance, fine-tuning a base Mistral 7-billion-parameter model using a dataset generated by AgentInstruct resulted in the creation of Orca-3-Mistral, which exhibited substantial improvements across multiple benchmarks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;40% improvement on AGIEval&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;19% improvement on MMLU&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;54% improvement on GSM8K&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;38% improvement on BBH&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;45% improvement on AlpacaEval&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;31.34% reduction in inaccuracies across summarization benchmarks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its advantages, generating high-quality synthetic data is not without challenges. Previous research indicates that training models on synthetic data produced by other models can lead to model collapse, where the trained model degrades over time. This issue often arises from the imitation process, where models learn stylistic features rather than actual capabilities. Thus, generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data necessitates substantial human effort in curating and filtering the datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emergence of agentic workflows, particularly multi-agent systems like AutoGen, has transformed the landscape of synthetic data generation. These workflows can produce high-quality data that surpasses the capabilities of underlying LLMs by incorporating reflection and iteration processes. Agents can critique their outputs and improve upon them using tools such as search APIs, calculators, and code interpreters to address LLM limitations effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AgentInstruct is designed specifically for generative teaching—an approach that aims to produce abundant, diverse, and challenging datasets to teach specific skills to AI models. By utilizing raw documents as input, AgentInstruct generates demonstration and feedback data that can enhance an LLM’s capabilities in various domains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Quality Data:&lt;/strong&gt; Leveraging GPT-4 along with tools like search and code interpreters ensures the generated data meets high standards.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diverse Data:&lt;/strong&gt; By employing specialized agents and a taxonomy of over 100 subcategories, AgentInstruct guarantees diversity in prompts and responses.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Quantities of Data:&lt;/strong&gt; The autonomous nature of AgentInstruct allows it to generate extensive datasets without requiring seed prompts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key innovations introduced by AgentInstruct is its ability to use raw data as seeds for generating synthetic datasets. This method offers two significant advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;The abundance of raw data facilitates the creation of large-scale datasets.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This approach encourages learning general skills rather than being limited to benchmark-specific capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advancements brought forth by Orca-AgentInstruct signal a promising future for synthetic data generation within AI development. As agentic flows become increasingly integral throughout the model-training lifecycle—encompassing pre-training, post-training, and specialization—there is potential for creating a synthetic data factory that enables continuous improvement in model training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of Orca-AgentInstruct represents a significant leap forward in the field of synthetic data generation. By harnessing agentic flows to produce high-quality, diverse datasets at scale, Microsoft is paving the way for more effective fine-tuning of language models. As this technology continues to evolve, it holds great promise for advancing AI capabilities across multiple industries, making high-quality model training more efficient and accessible.

Users can initiate a web search either automatically based on their queries or manually by clicking the web search icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Key Features of ChatGPT Search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timely Answers:&lt;/strong&gt; Users can receive fast responses to their inquiries, including access to current sports scores, news updates, stock quotes, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source Linking:&lt;/strong&gt; Each chat response includes links to original sources, allowing users to explore further information directly from reputable publishers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Contextual Understanding:&lt;/strong&gt; ChatGPT can consider the full context of previous interactions to provide more accurate and relevant follow-up answers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User-Centric Design:&lt;/strong&gt; The interface is designed for ease of use, enabling seamless integration of search results into conversations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of search functionality within ChatGPT represents a significant advancement in how users access information. By allowing for a conversational approach to queries, OpenAI enables users to engage with data in a more intuitive manner. This not only enhances user experience but also encourages deeper exploration of topics through follow-up questions and discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI has actively collaborated with numerous publishers and news organizations to ensure that ChatGPT Search delivers high-quality content. Partners include well-known entities such as the Associated Press, Reuters, and Financial Times. This collaboration ensures that users are directed to credible sources while providing publishers an opportunity to reach broader audiences through the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The search model utilized in ChatGPT Search is a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o. It employs advanced synthetic data generation techniques and leverages third-party search providers along with content from OpenAI's partners. This sophisticated technology allows for efficient retrieval of relevant information tailored to user inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenAI plans to continue enhancing ChatGPT Search by focusing on areas such as shopping and travel, utilizing the reasoning capabilities of its o1 series models for deeper research. Future updates will also expand access to Free users and improve functionalities across various platforms, including Advanced Voice and canvas integrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By combining the strengths of conversational AI with real-time web search capabilities, OpenAI is setting a new standard for how users interact with information online.
