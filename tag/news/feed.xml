      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/RunwayTTV">&lt;p&gt;As it is stated &lt;a href=&quot;https://runwayml.com/blog/introducing-gen-3-alpha/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;q&gt;Gen-3 Alpha is the first of an upcoming series of models trained by Runway on a new infrastructure built for large-scale multimodal training. It is a major improvement in fidelity, consistency, and motion over Gen-2, and a step towards building General World Models.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the results we see, we should be excited about upcoming Text to Video, Image to Video and Text to Image tools that will be available for us to use. You can take a deeper view on their products &lt;a href=&quot;https://runwayml.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and try runway for free &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.runwayml.com/signup&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; I don't know about you but I can't wait to check the upcoming models they have to offer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you that have not yet got the chance to know Runway, it is founded in 2018 by Cristóbal Valenzuela, Anastasis Germanidis and Alejandro Matamala-Ortiz. As Paul Drews and Emily Zhao writting at &lt;a href=&quot;https://salesforceventures.com/perspectives/welcome-runway/&quot;&gt;Salesforce ventures.&lt;/a&gt; The initial idea came out of Cris’ thesis project at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU, where he met his co-founders while researching applications of machine learning models for image and video use in the creative domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informed by their own experiences as artists, the Runway co-founders set out to answer the question of how a well-built digital tool could simplify the approachability of complex ML models and circumvent the need for deep technical background to give better access to state of the art machine intelligence to artists and designers. The mission of Runway was to democratize access to machine learning so more people can start thinking of new and creative ways to use those models.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>http://localhost:4000/NVIDIARelease</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/NVIDIARelease">&lt;p&gt;Nemotron-4 340B, a family of models optimized for NVIDIA NeMo and NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, includes cutting-edge instruct and reward models, and a dataset for generative AI training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA on 14th of June, announced Nemotron-4 340B, a family of open models that developers can use to generate synthetic data for training large language models (LLMs) for commercial applications across healthcare, finance, manufacturing, retail and every other industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-quality training data plays a critical role in the performance, accuracy and quality of responses from a custom LLM — but robust datasets can be prohibitively expensive and difficult to access. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a uniquely permissive open model license, Nemotron-4 340B gives developers a free, scalable way to generate synthetic data that can help build powerful LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nemotron-4 340B family includes base, instruct and reward models that form a pipeline to generate synthetic data used for training and refining LLMs. The models are optimized to work with NVIDIA NeMo, an open-source framework for end-to-end model training, including data curation, customization and evaluation. They’re also optimized for inference with the open-source NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM library. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nemotron-4 340B can be downloaded now from the NVIDIA NGC catalog and Hugging Face. Developers will soon be able to access the models at ai.nvidia.com, where they’ll be packaged as an NVIDIA NIM microservice with a standard application programming interface that can be deployed anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
