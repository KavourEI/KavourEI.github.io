      <link href="http://localhost:4000/tulu3" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tülu 3 405B The New Heavyweight Champion in AI Models" />
      <published>2025-01-30T00:00:00+02:00</published>
      <updated>2025-01-30T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://localhost:4000/tulu3</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/tulu3">&lt;p&gt;Hold onto your hats, all of you people! The Allen Institute for AI has just unleashed &lt;a href=&quot;https://allenai.org/blog/tulu-3-technical&quot;&gt;Tülu 3 405B&lt;/a&gt;, a colossal 405-billion-parameter model that's not just flexing its muscles but also outpacing the competition. This update is setting new benchmarks, leaving rivals like DeepSeek V3 and GPT-4o &lt;i&gt;in the dust&lt;/i&gt;, all while being as open-source as a community cookbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/64837/1738270804-image-23.png?fit=max&amp;amp;fm=webp&amp;amp;h=810&amp;amp;w=1550&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 30, 2025, the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) proudly introduced Tülu 3 405B, marking the first time fully open post-training recipes have been applied to such a massive open-weight model. Building upon the success of their previous Tülu 3 release, this model demonstrates that size does matter, especially when combined with innovative training techniques. Tülu 3 405B doesn't just compete; it often surpasses models like DeepSeek V3 and GPT-4o, and leaves prior open-weight models, including Llama 3.1 405B Instruct and Nous Hermes 3 405B, eating its dust on many standard benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how did Ai2 cook up this powerhouse? They scaled their proven Tülu 3 post-training recipe to the Llama-405B base model, following a five-step program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Delicacy:&lt;/strong&gt; Carefully curating and synthesizing data targeting core skills.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supervised Finetuning (SFT):&lt;/strong&gt; Applying a finely selected mix of prompts and their completions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Preference Optimization (DPO):&lt;/strong&gt; Tweaking the model based on both off- and on-policy preference data.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR):&lt;/strong&gt; A fresh, RL-based method to boost specific skills with rewards you can take to the bank.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation Extravaganza:&lt;/strong&gt; Implementing a standardized suite for development, decontamination, and final evaluation stages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the training arena, Ai2 employed their novel RLVR approach, focusing on tasks with clear-cut answers like math problems and precise instructions. To handle the 405B scale, they deployed the model using vLLM with 16-way tensor parallelism, utilizing 240 GPUs for training. Each RLVR iteration involved approximately 550 seconds for inference, 25 seconds for weight transfer, and 1500 seconds for training. Interestingly, they discovered that feeding the model exclusively MATH data, rather than a mix, yielded better results at this scale—a testament to the model's appetite for complex, specialized tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/64837/1738199366-rlvr-diagram.png?dpr=2&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;fm=webp&amp;amp;h=810&amp;amp;w=1550&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tülu 3 405B isn't just big; it's a top performer. It achieves competitive or superior results compared to both DeepSeek V3 and GPT-4o, while also surpassing prior open-weight post-trained models of the same size on many standard benchmarks. Notably, the Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework improved MATH performance more significantly at this larger scale, echoing findings in the DeepSeek-R1 report. Overall, Tülu 3 405B shows a consistent edge over DeepSeek V3, especially when safety benchmarks are in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.datocms-assets.com/64837/1738199543-405b_rl.png?dpr=2&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;fm=webp&amp;amp;h=810&amp;amp;w=1550&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Tülu 3 405B, Ai2 has not only scaled up their model parameters but also the impact of open-source AI. This release underscores the scalability and effectiveness of their post-training recipe at an unprecedented scale, setting a new standard in the AI community. As Tülu 3 405B continues to flex its capabilities, it's clear that the future of AI is not just about bigger models, but smarter, more open ones too.

&lt;p&gt;The landscape of audio production is undergoing a transformation with the introduction of advanced generative AI technologies. NVIDIA's latest innovation, &lt;strong&gt;Fugatto&lt;/strong&gt;, represents a significant leap forward in sound generation and manipulation. This foundational generative audio transformer model empowers users to create, modify, and transform audio using simple text prompts, enabling a level of control and creativity previously unattainable. This article explores the capabilities of Fugatto, its applications across various industries, and the technology that powers it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is Fugatto?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fugatto, short for Foundational Generative Audio Transformer Opus 1, is designed to generate or transform any mix of music, voices, and sounds based on user-defined prompts. Unlike traditional models that may specialize in one aspect of audio production—such as composing music or altering voices—Fugatto combines these functions into a versatile tool that can create entirely new sounds on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ido Zmishlany, a multi-platinum producer and songwriter, remarked, “The idea that I can create entirely new sounds on the fly in the studio is incredible.” This capability positions Fugat to as a &quot;Swiss Army knife&quot; for sound production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Key Features of Fugatto&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Task Audio Generation:&lt;/strong&gt; Fugatto supports numerous tasks including music composition, voice modulation, and sound effects creation.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emergent Properties:&lt;/strong&gt; The model showcases emergent properties that arise from the interaction of its trained abilities, allowing for complex audio outputs from simple prompts.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artistic Control:&lt;/strong&gt; Users can combine free-form instructions to achieve desired tonal qualities and emotional expressions in their audio outputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Applications Across Industries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The versatility of Fugatto opens up numerous possibilities across various fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music Production:&lt;/strong&gt; Producers can use Fugatto to quickly prototype song ideas by experimenting with different styles and instruments.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising:&lt;/strong&gt; Ad agencies can tailor voiceovers for different regions by applying various accents and emotional tones to existing campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; Language learning platforms can personalize experiences by using familiar voices for instructional content.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Game Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Developers can modify existing audio assets or create new sounds dynamically based on gameplay actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Unique Approach to Sound Creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA's team behind Fugatto has developed several innovative techniques that enhance the model's capabilities. One notable feature is called &lt;strong&gt;ComposableART&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows users to combine multiple instructions during inference. For instance, a user could prompt the model to generate speech with a specific emotional tone in a particular accent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fine-grained control over attributes enables users to explore artistic expressions in ways that were previously limited. Rohan Badlani, an AI researcher involved in designing these features, noted that this approach allows users to feel like artists themselves while working with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Technology Behind Fugatto&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foundation of Fugatto lies in its architecture as a generative transformer model. It utilizes 2.5 billion parameters and was trained on an extensive dataset using NVIDIA DGX systems equipped with powerful NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs. This robust infrastructure enables Fugatto to perform complex audio tasks with high fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development process involved creating a blended dataset containing millions of audio samples. The team employed innovative strategies to generate diverse data inputs while achieving accurate performance across various tasks without needing additional data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;User Experience: Creating New Sounds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A standout capability of Fugatto is its ability to generate novel sounds based on user descriptions. For example, it can produce unique sound effects like making a trumpet bark or a saxophone meow—demonstrating its versatility in sound design. Moreover, with fine-tuning using small amounts of singing data, Fugatto can generate high-quality singing voices from text prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Future of Audio Production&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of Fugatto signals an exciting new chapter in audio production technology. By providing creators with powerful tools to manipulate sound through intuitive text prompts, NVIDIA is paving the way for innovative applications across music, film, gaming, and beyond.
