    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Port to Other Languages:&lt;/strong&gt; Code can be translated into various programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying GPT-4o model has been trained specifically for collaboration, allowing it to understand when to open a Canvas and how to make targeted edits. OpenAI's research team has focused on developing core behaviors that enhance this collaborative experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Core Behaviors Include:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Triggering Canvas:&lt;/strong&gt; The model intelligently decides when to open a Canvas based on user prompts.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diverse Content Generation:&lt;/strong&gt; It can generate various types of content effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit and Rewrite:&lt;/strong&gt; The model makes targeted edits or rewrites based on user selections.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inline Critique:&lt;/strong&gt; Provides constructive feedback on user-generated content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of Canvas marks a significant evolution in how users interact with AI tools. OpenAI plans to rapidly improve its capabilities based on user feedback during this early beta phase, aiming to enhance both functionality and user experience further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch of Canvas represents a transformative approach to working with ChatGPT, making it an invaluable tool for writers and developers alike. As OpenAI continues to refine this feature, users can look forward to an even more powerful collaborative experience that enhances creativity and productivity in their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
